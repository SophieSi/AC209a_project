Summary
The Association Between Childhood Seizures and Later Childhood Emotional and Behavioral Problems


This paper studies the association of childhood seizures, divided into epilepsy, single unprovoked seizures and febrile
convulsions, with later childhood emotional/behavioral problems at age 7/11/16 years.

Multivariate logistic regression and modified Poisson regression model are used to:
a)	evaluate the association of social disadvantages and FRIs (fetal risk indicators) with childhood seizures by age 7 years
b)	evaluate the association of childhood seizures by age 7 years with later childhood emotional/behavioral problems
c)	evaluate the association of childhood seizures by age 7 years with emotional/behavioral disorders in later childhood,
 after accounting for social disadvantage and FRIs

The study shows that the association of epilepsy with emotional/behavioral problems, at 7/11/16 years, remains significant
even after accounting for indicators of social disadvantage and fetal life. Thus, early childhood epilepsy is worth
consideration in dealing with mental health problems. In addition, there is also a strong relationship between single
unprovoked seizures and emotional/behavioral problems at age 16 years.
