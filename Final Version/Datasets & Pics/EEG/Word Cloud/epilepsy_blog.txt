Epilepsy Blog Relay™: My Wife, #MyEpilepsyHero
 by Jessica Keenan Smith |  posted in: Blog Relay, Nov 16 EBR Posts |  0
This post is part of the Epilepsy Blog Relay™ which will run from November 1 through November 30, 2016. Follow along!

This blog post was submitted by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., the Founding Sponsor of the November 2016 Epilepsy Blog Relay.

Phil’s Story
In 1991, my wife, Jill, and I said goodnight to our happy four-year-old son, Philip, and tucked him in to bed. The next morning we found him on the floor in the throes of his first seizure. Jill and I were terrified. Philip stayed in intensive care for four days and just a few weeks later, he started having multiple seizures on a daily basis. That was the beginning of our epilepsy journey.

Back then, the internet wasn’t the reliable resource for health information that it is today. We were unable to find resources for treatment, and we felt scared, hopeless and alone. It was Jill who found the information and specialized care we needed through The Epilepsy Foundation. The Foundation also helped us find a parent support group that served as much more than a resource – we found hope in a group of parents who, like us, were determined to find answers.

My Wife
Jill always believed that we had to keep trying to find the very best care for Philip. Fast forward to today, and Philip is now 30 years old and living independently. He’s become a college graduate, full-time employee and loving husband.

As for Jill? She never ceased her commitment to learning about epilepsy and helping patients. After Philip’s diagnosis, she returned to school to earn her Registered Nurse degree and eventually was recruited to work at the same epilepsy center that helped treat Philip. She worked as an epilepsy nurse for 12 years, helping thousands of patients and families receive the specialized treatment they need. It’s no surprise that she constantly receives calls to serve as an epilepsy nurse specialist – this is her calling.

I am exceedingly grateful for the work of epilepsy advocates, clinicians, researchers, caregivers, individuals with epilepsy, families, donors, and those in industry who make a difference working to end epilepsy and supporting other individuals and families impacted by the condition. Caregivers make a tremendous sacrifice and that’s why my wife, Jill, is without a doubt #MyEpilepsyHero. Not only is our son where he is today because of her love and tireless dedication, but she has also helped countless epilepsy patients and families throughout the years. What she has done – and continues to do – is nothing short of remarkable.

#MyEpilepsyHero
That’s why I am so proud to be participating in #MyEpilepsyHero. The campaign encourages people impacted by epilepsy to recognize those who have made a positive difference in their lives by posting details about their heroes on social media along with #MyEpilepsyHero.

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: Coping with the holidays

Emily’s Perspective
It’s the most wonderful time of the year!!! Christmas and wintertime are my favourite time of year, and for so many others too, but this festive season can be a difficult time for people with epilepsy and associated conditions as there can be triggers.

Holiday lights
If someone has an Epileptic seizure when looking at flashing or flickering lights, this is a sign that they possibly have photosensitive epilepsy. Whether you celebrate Christmas or not, it is inevitable that there will be hundreds of Christmas lights around you for a month or so, some of which can be flashy, and by that I don’t mean ostentatiously attractive.

Christmas lights and decorations put up by organizations should not flash at a rate that could trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy. The unit of frequency lights are measured is in Hz. Most people with photosensitive epilepsy are sensitive to 16-25 Hz. Although organizations generally follow guidelines for the public, individual stores that sell tree lights do not have to comply with health and safety regulations, so this can be the main worry for people living with epilepsy.

Tips to protect against holiday lights
Although I cannot stop your seizures or my seizures, I can offer you some tips on preventing seizures and protecting yourself from those flickering lights.

My top tip for preventing a seizure due to photosensitivity is cover one eye. Sounds odd, right? But it works. Cover one eye and turn away from the source of flashing lights. Researchers have found that if only one eye is exposed to the flickering screen, a smaller area of the brain’s cortex is affected than when both eyes are exposed. The difference is significant enough to greatly reduce the likelihood of a seizure.
My other tips for you for keeping those seizures at rest is to get plenty of sleep each night. Christmas is exciting for the little ones, so in the run up to the holidays — set a regular sleep schedule, and stick to it. I tend to wind down by 9pm, read a book or sit watching a bit of tv before heading straight to bed.
Learn stress management and relaxation techniques.
Plan Ahead. Start making a list of things you need to do for Christmas early. We get our shopping (food & decorations) ready weeks beforehand; it’s easy to make a list so you can tick off what you have done and what is left to do.
Stress and crowds
Write your cards early, wrap your gifts early and even buy your gifts months before. Christmas soon arrives and I hate shopping when hundreds of people are in the shops at once, this is a huge trigger for me. If it’s already too late for you to plan now, save this article for next year!

Know when to stop
Decide when you will stop your Christmas preparations and start to relax and enjoy the holiday.  Work towards and try to stick to this goal, even if it is in the late afternoon on Christmas Eve.  Remember that Christmas is your holiday too. Don’t spend it being stressed.

Practice your breathing
When we’re stressed our heart beat increases and our breathing shallows. Breathe in deeply through your nose, and then breathe slowly out through your mouth, repeat for a few minutes to instantly help reduce stressful feelings. And remember, keep moving – keeping up your regular exercise routine can give you the fitness and stamina to make it through the demands of the festive season. Even an evening walk will help a lot.

Make a schedule
If you’re struggling with managing time on the day, and you need a little help, try writing a holiday schedule. I do this everyday! But on Christmas it is especially useful. Make a note of when you want to put the turkey in the oven or when to start making the crumble.

Forget the drinks, remember the meds
The next big tip is to avoid the alcohol. I don’t mean avoid it altogether, but try not to overdo it; excessive alcohol dehydrates your body and makes your liver work overtime to process it. Alcohol can also mix badly with anti-convulsions, so be careful.

With all the excitement it is easy to forget to take all of your medications. Make an alert on your phone or to do list, to ensure you take your medications as normal. Skipping your meds can be a huge seizure trigger.

Have fun
It’s your holiday too, so remember to relax and have fun, laugh and be thankful. Christmas time is the chance to spend time with your loved ones, a time to enjoy and to be thankful. Skip TV and computer time whenever possible. Excessive use of the TV or computer can be a big strain and although it’s easy to get drawn in by all the holiday shows or those games your children may have received for the PC, it is important that you take time away and give your eyes and brain a little rest.

If things don’t go to plan, do not to worry, instead laugh about them and make them into fun memories that you can talk about during holidays to come. Have a great, stress-free, holiday season!

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: Jonny is Not Disabled
 by Jessica Keenan Smith |  posted in: Blog Relay, Nov 16 EBR Posts |  0

Kathleen’s Story
Seeing Jonathan today you could not guess at the difficulties he has faced. The frustration of a body that no longer responded to his every whim, of having to sit in a stroller in silence when he had so much to say and do, and seeing the world happen around him, but being unable to interact. This experienced has shaped Jonny in a very positive way. I wrote this when he was 8. He is now 15, and living with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

Jonathan has an indomitable spirit. When Jonny was first learning to walk again, the physical therapist tried to help hold him up, but he pushed him away. Jonny preferred a kind of crawl/drag where he would grab hold of the rug or chair with his good arm and drag his body behind. He wasn’t going to accept help from anyone if he could do it himself.

Not Disabled
Don’t ever think of Jon as handicapped, he’s not. He is different from what people expect from a child his age, but he is not handicapped.  He is almost 8 years old, and he’s not even close to being potty trained. He’s working on a K-4 curriculum this year, and it’s challenging for him but that’s not the whole story.  Jonny has more love in his heart and compassion than anyone I know.  He understands the needs of others and works to meet them.

He has never met a stranger. In his eyes, there’s nothing that can’t be fixed by a kind word and a hug. The more stern or angry looking the person is; the more likely Jon will feel the need to let them know they are loved.

My children and I were leaving Wal-Mart one evening. We noticed a group of rough-looking young men. They were twenty-something year old’s all dressed in similar clothes with lots of bling (gold jewelry), and they were parked next to us. The driver looked at us with disgust when we past close to him. Jon stopped and looked up into his face.

“What?” The young man growled at him.

Jon beamed, “I like you!”

The young man’s whole face changed. With those three words Jon had broken down the impenetrable walls of the young man’s heart. He squatted down so he was eye-level with Jon. A face which moments earlier had displayed arrogance and loathing was now filled with kindness and compassion. “Well, I like you too!”  He smiled at Jon.

He must have sat and spoke to Jon for 5 minutes. The young man’s eyes were moist with tears. They hugged, for a long moment. Jonathan is not disabled for God is able to use him in mighty ways. His lack of boundaries affords an ability to show love far greater than any “normal” person.

This post was written by Kathleen Dale who lives in Fort White, Florida, and is mom to Jonathan who has Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS).
The November 2016 Epilepsy Blog Relay™ was sponsored by Lundbeck – a global pharmaceutical company committed to improving the quality of life for those living with brain disorders, including epilepsy. Lundbeck connects people living with challenging seizures at www.LGSTogether.com and through the LGS Together Facebook page (www.facebook.com/LGSTogether).

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: Shedding light on my epilepsy
 by Alison Zetterquist |  posted in: Blog Relay, Nov 16 EBR Posts |  0
7tbl5xjf8hvcg80pzfhd_400x400This post is part of the Epilepsy Blog Relay™ which will run from November 1 through November 30, 2016. Follow along!

Alison’s Story
In 1976, I had my first tonic-clonic seizure. I was in my high school hallway between classes (read: spectators all around), having felt all morning as though I was disconnected, somehow reading everyone’s minds. What an aura.

The next thing I knew I was in the Concord, NH, hospital, while they tried to determine if I was “an epileptic.” And so began my feeling of being the other, of being weird, and of humiliation. My cognitive abilities just weren’t what they used to be. Was it the epilepsy or the phenobarbital that, at the time, was the go-to medicine for teens? Regardless, it was me, and I was less of a person to my way of thinking.

Fairly soon, I moved onto more effective meds, which allowed me control. My self-esteem stayed damaged though, and like so many, I hid my condition. I only dealt with it when I would forget to take pills and have a full-out grand mall seizure – usually with people who didn’t expect it because, that’s right, I hadn’t told them about my epilepsy.

Hiding in the shadows
What a waste. Not only was I in a dangerous part of the shadows, I wasn’t handling the root of my problem, the stigma. Furthermore I was missing out on an opportunity to help many others’ find their way out of their uneasiness about epilepsy by giving them the information they need to view it realistically.

As the years went on, I had seizures every few years, but only when I forgot to take my meds. Because I was covering up my epilepsy, I hadn’t told people around me at work or even good friends that I have epilepsy. It was a shock to all. And I owe them apologies for having put them through my tonic-clonic episodes without knowing how to respond.

Shedding light on epilepsy
Growing weary of my self-diminishing secrecy, I decided to change 38 years later. I looked for opportunities to tell others with whom I have a positive relationship that I have epilepsy, how common a condition it is on a wide spectrum, and how to handle someone having a seizure. I found openings when asked what my medical bracelet was for and waited for other appropriate moments to begin spreading the word. It got easier and easier, and my hypothesis is that the stigma often lies in others’ fears began to bear out. I could see the body language unclenching as those I spoke to learned facts that put them at ease with the possibility of being faced with a seizure and not knowing what to do.

Courage to carry on
Granted, these may be especially open-minded people, but it did bolster my courage to continue on. I’ve found that almost all those I’ve told haven’t let me down.

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: Greg Grunberg thanks a few of his epilepsy heroes
 by Jessica Keenan Smith |  posted in: Blog Relay, Nov 16 EBR Posts |  0
myepilepsyhero_facebookheroimage_eventpageThis post is part of the Epilepsy Blog Relay™, which will run from November 1 to November 30, 2016. Follow along!

This blog post was submitted by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., the Founding Sponsor of the November 2016 Epilepsy Blog Relay. Greg received compensation from Sunovion for this post.

Greg’s Story
November is important to me because it’s a full month dedicated to raising awareness of epilepsy, a condition that’s near and dear to my heart. My son Jake, who is now 20, was diagnosed with the condition 13 years ago, and our lives have never been the same. Check out my post from earlier this month where I share details about Jake’s journey with epilepsy. So what better time than the present to take a step back and celebrate those individuals who are the everyday epilepsy heroes?

Jake is my number one epilepsy hero, without a doubt. At one point, Jake’s epilepsy was severe; he was having seizures frequently. We had to explore a lot of different treatment options until we found what worked for him. He had to have surgery and is now on five medications to help manage his seizures. Jake has good days and bad days, but through it all, he’s determined to live life to the fullest. I continue to be amazed by him, and I am proud of him every single day. That’s why he’s #MyEpilepsyHero.

Who are my other epilepsy heroes? Among them are the amazing doctors who treat people living with this condition. They are always there for their patients; I’ve seen it over and over again. They offer a level of compassion and care that is above and beyond. On top of it all, they take time from their personal lives – time away from their own families – to help their patients, and I cannot thank them enough for all that they do.

my epilepsy hero

#MYEPILEPSYHERO
Now that I’ve shared who my epilepsy heroes are, I want to hear from you! I’ve teamed up with the Epilepsy Foundation and Sunovion Pharmaceuticals on #MyEpilepsyHero, because I think it’s really important that we stop for a second and celebrate the many heroes in the world of epilepsy. From patients and physicians to advocates and caregivers, it is the everyday people that have a real and lasting impact on this condition that affects millions. That’s why we’re encouraging people impacted by epilepsy to recognize those who have made a positive difference in their lives by posting details about their heroes on social media along with #MyEpilepsyHero. I’ll be posting more details about my heroes throughout the month, and I can’t wait to see what you share!

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: My brand new adventure
 by Maureen Knorr |  posted in: Blog Relay, Nov 16 EBR Posts, Traveling with Epilepsy |  0
maureen2This post is part of the Epilepsy Blog Relay™ which will run from November 1 through November 30, 2016. Follow along!

Maureen’s Story
In July, I went through the most fulfilling and rewarding experience of my life. All mothers out there know the experience. My beautiful daughter, Samantha, was born on July 16th, 10:50am, happy and healthy, and immediately filled my heart full of joy. After 9 months of a carefully managed pregnancy, and 5 months before that of slowly transitioning my epilepsy medication, I could finally say, “I did it. And I knew I could do it.”

 

Other mothers had warned me that I would be tired and spread thin. Their predictions were, of course, spot on; I was exhausted. Thankfully, their warnings also came with tips and tricks like “sleep when baby sleeps”, “a stroller walk always calms a crying baby”, and many, many more. But there was no advice, tips, or tricks that prepared me to be a mother with a seizure disorder. Now, my world has changed in so many ways, including how I am living with epilepsy. What I’ve written about in the past, is my adventurous spirit inside saying that epilepsy can’t hold me back. But now, I feel a very sudden change in the risks I take.

 

At first, everyday ordinary things were overwhelming. I was anxious when holding or carrying my daughter. It’s such a natural thing for a mother to embrace her child, but I was afraid I would drop her. The “stroller walk” that all seasoned parents recommend for calming a crying baby was terrifying to me. I couldn’t help but imagine having a little jerk and knocking the stroller over. Or even worse, it rolling down the hill unmanned. Everything felt dangerous knowing that at any moment I could have a seizure. But I knew I had to pull myself together as our first trip was around the corner.

 

maureen1Our First Adventure
I wish I could say I confidently navigated my way through the airport for my daughters first flight; daughter in arms and boarding pass in pocket! But truthfully I was a wimp with my internal monologue of “don’t have a seizure” on repeat.  It was my husband that carried her, changed her, and burped her while I stood on the sidelines. The following day would be different as my husband would be busy with the wedding party. It would be just my daughter and me for the day.

 

Just us
We were staying at Fair Hills Resort in Minnesota. We had a small cabin on the far end of the lake that was secluded and quiet. When my husband left to meet the other groomsmen I had a fleeting thought of  “what if I have a seizure” but I quickly pushed that thought aside and filled myself up with all the fun “firsts” my daughter would be able to experience today. I was excited to take her for a long walk on the lake; after all, she’d never seen a lake before!

 

The unpaved trail around the lake wasn’t exactly stroller friendly so I carried my daughter in my arms. I kept a safe distance away from the water and held her tightly to my chest as we embarked on her first walk (ever) around the lake. She was wide-eyed in awe of the towering trees and bright blue sky. Seeing her inquisitive eyes scanning the scenery filled my heart with joy. As we continued walking I spotted a shallow entrance to the lake. I took off my shoes, waded in and slowly dipped my daughters’ toes in the cold water. Her lips pursed and immediately turned into a frown. Immediately after the frown she made a loud squawking noise that could only translate to, “get my toes out of the water!” I lifted her to my chest and used my shirt to dry her toes, and slowly made my way to the trail. As I was putting my shoes back on my wet feet I realized that I had always been frightened to be around water alone. But here I was wading in to dunk my daughter’s toes! Her sense of wonder had boosted my confidence.

 

Every day a new adventuremaureen-3
My experience in Minnesota made me realize that as a protective mother I feel hesitant at times, but also recognize that now I have a greater responsibility to not let epilepsy hold me back. Seeing the world through my daughter’s eyes makes each and every day an adventure. She makes me appreciate the small things in life like going for a walk, feeling the rain on my skin, and even just examining the colors of an apple. The spirit inside of me has only grown to take into account instilling this sense of exploration & curiosity of life into my daughter. Upon returning from this vacation, I immediately printed out a passport application and went to Walgreens to have my daughter’s photo taken. After all, it’s time to plan our next adventure.

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: Epilepsy has made me who I am
 by Jessica |  posted in: Blog Relay, Nov 16 EBR Posts |  0
This post is part of the Epilepsy Blog Relay™ which will run from November 1 through November 30, 2016. Follow along!

Jessica’s Story
I was diagnosed with epilepsy when I was in about 7 years old. It took so many tests for my diagnosis, and no child likes being poked and prodded with needles, having electrodes stuck all over them and being put in a noisy MRI scanner. Originally the doctors thought I had diabetes, this killed my mum, which I didn’t really understand. Then the diagnosis of epilepsy came and my mum was slightly relieved. Although now she says she wishes it was diabetes.

Growing up was difficult. Trying so many medications to get the right one caused me to have some insane side effects. One made me think I was a fish (I walked around making the ‘bob’ face like a fish and didn’t speak at all). Another made me write both backwards and upside down. Let me just say, a) that’s pretty scary, and b) I’m sure they thought I was possessed! Once the right medication was found things started looking up, I sat my year 6 sats and got straight 5s. I was a clever kid who loved to learn.

Then I moved to high school and things didn’t look great. My seizures became so bad and my cognitive functioning deteriorated so much they didn’t think I’d be able to get GCSE’s. I was constantly watched over and never allowed to be on my own. It was really tough and it had a bad effect on my social life. My friends would go on trips to town and the cinema and I had to stay at home in case I had a seizure.

Never let it stop me
Luckily things picked up and I got alright GCSEs and got into college. I’ve never let my epilepsy stop me. I didn’t want it to define me, but epilepsy has made me who I am. I eventually went traveling to Kenya in 2011, and Gambia in 2014 both volunteering with charities. I wasn’t going to let my epilepsy get in my way.

Now I’m at university, studying psychology and I’m about to complete my final year. I’d love a 1st but I think I’ll get a 2.1 but that isn’t too bad for someone the doctors said wouldn’t get GCSEs.

Life is good and I now embrace my epilepsy. If I didn’t have it, my life could have turned out completely differently. Epilepsy has had its negative effects but epilepsy has made me who I am. On the whole it’s been a good journey to this point.

Heading to work
The scary thing is going into the working world. I can’t drive. I know this will make it harder to get a job, especially in the field I want, but I know it will happen. My faith has helped me through my life. It has picked me up when I felt terrible about myself and been frustrated with my epilepsy. I’ve molded my life around it and I know my limits. I try not to push them but I am a student after all!

Living well with epilepsy
I have great friends and family, and an awesome boyfriend who look after me when my seizures are bad and support me and for that I am thankful and blessed. I’m 22 and life is good. I have epilepsy, but I am not epilepsy. And, I am certainly not an epilepsy sufferer!

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: Using Tech for Good in an LGS Hackathon
 by Jessica Keenan Smith |  posted in: Blog Relay, Nov 16 EBR Posts |  0
This post is part of the Epilepsy Blog Relay™ which will run from November 1 through November 30, 2016. Follow along!

Disclaimer: This post was submitted by Eisai Inc., the Champion Level Sponsor of the November 2016 Epilepsy Blog Relay™.

When Tech Makes a Difference
Technology plays a key role in our lives on a daily basis. We are continuously using technology to provide us with access to more information about news, culture and most importantly, our health. From Skype sessions with doctors to wearable garments that can detect your every move, technology is transforming the health space. It was with these types of technological advancements in mind that Eisai Inc. and the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) Foundation came up with the idea to hold a hackathon event in New York City earlier this year. A hackathon is an event that brings programmers together to participate in collaborative computer programming, providing a venue for self-expression and creativity through technology.

#HackLGS
The event, called #HackLGS, brought together LGS caregivers, technology developers, students and creative specialists to explore the complexities of living with, or caring for, someone with LGS with the ultimate goal of identifying resources or digital tools that can provide a tangible benefit to the LGS community. The objective was to assemble a dynamic group aimed at alleviating the damaging effects of the condition on patients, their caregivers and families. #HackLGS was the first event of its kind to address this form of epilepsy.

Eisai and the LGS Foundation convened key members of the LGS community and experts in the technology space to share insights about the disease and how new technical innovations may help address the unmet needs in this community. Although people may be familiar with epilepsy or seizures in general, most haven’t heard of LGS.1 LGS is one of the more rare and severe forms of childhood epilepsy, characterized by multiple seizure types, cognitive impairment or developmental delays.1 It is also a physically dangerous epilepsy syndrome, given the frequent falls and injuries often associated with the disease.2 The syndrome accounts for up to 4 percent of all childhood epilepsy cases.3

The event kicked off with LGS caregivers sharing their experiences, challenges and needs in order to get across the true burden and scope of challenges life with LGS can sometimes present. The group then worked through various creative ideas and technological solutions to remedy the everyday problems associated with LGS. After two days of brainstorming, strategizing and planning, the group developed several ideas aimed at making a difference in the lives of those in the LGS community. The LGS Hackathon served as a great opportunity to bring remarkable technology and new innovations to the LGS community that may ultimately help the lives of people living with difficult-to-manage diseases like LGS.

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: My Mom, #MyEpilepsyHero
 by Jessica Keenan Smith |  posted in: Blog Relay, Nov 16 EBR Posts |  0
sandra-mom-2This post is part of the Epilepsy Blog Relay™ which will run from November 1 through November 30, 2016. Follow along!

This blog post was submitted by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., the Founding Sponsor of the November 2016 Epilepsy Blog Relay. Sandra received compensation from Sunovion for this post.

Sandra’s Story
I was six years old when I was diagnosed with epilepsy. As a child, I couldn’t even pronounce the word “epilepsy,” let alone begin to understand what it would mean to live with the condition. I would have seizures at night, and I was scared because I couldn’t explain what was happening to my body. My mom, Sandra, was always there to stay with me through the seizures and calm me down, even though she was probably scared too.

I’m now 28 years old, and even though I’m older and epilepsy has become a part of who I am, my mom is still always there for me, providing unconditional love and support. And that’s why my mom is #MyEpilepsyHero. She really knows the ins and outs of what I’ve been through, and has been there for me every step of the way.

Even though it’s easier said than done, I try to maintain a positive attitude about the cards I’ve been dealt. I keep focused with school, and I keep pushing on. Every day is a step forward in my epilepsy journey. Without her even knowing, my mom has taught me how to be strong. She made me the warrior that I am today.

And now it’s my turn to take what I’ve learned from my mom, and pass it on to help others who may be going through similar situations. I want to encourage people who are living with epilepsy to be your own advocate, and do everything you can to live your best life with the condition. Educate yourself and ask questions – there are so many resources out there. Most importantly, know that you are not alone!

#MyEpilepsyHero
My mom is just one of the many unsung heroes when it comes to this condition. Epilepsy isn’t a condition that affects just the person that is living with it – it affects their loved ones as well. That’s why I’m participating in #MyEpilepsyHero. Created by the Epilepsy Foundation and Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, the campaign encourages people impacted by epilepsy to recognize those who have made a positive difference in their lives by posting details about their heroes on social media along with #MyEpilepsyHero.

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: Seizure education is a family affair
 by Guest Contributor |  posted in: Blog Relay, Nov 16 EBR Posts |  3
This post is part of the Epilepsy Blog Relay™ which will run from November 1 through November 30, 2016. Follow along!

Seizure Education with a Twist
Hi there! My name is Rachel Ehrhardt. I am thirty years old and reside in Houston, Texas. Thank you for taking the time to read this. It truly means way more than you know. It blows me away how much I am supported.

Many people over the years have asked me what it is like to have a seizure and what to do to help. The month of November has historically been recognized as Epilepsy Awareness Month. I thought this was the perfect time to remind about readers what certain seizures look like and how to treat them. I also thought it would be cool to tell you the types of seizures that my family has and what they are like from first hand experience.

Dad’s Seizures
Firstly, my father and I both suffer from Tonic Clonic seizures. These are the seizures that people usually associate with epilepsy. Tonic clonic seizures were previously called grand-mal seizures. Tonic clonic seizures affect the entire brain. I like to think about a tonic clonic as your entire body running a marathon in a few minutes, except with a seizure you have to also think that the person’s full brain is firing at the same time as well.

When Dad and I have our seizures the first phase for us is the tonic phase where we both tend to bite our tongues or the inside of our mouthes. This is perfect time to bring this up as well, people having seizures cannot and will not swallow their tongues. Do not under any circumstance put your hands or anything else into their mouths.

The next phase is the clonic portion of these seizures. I would encourage making sure the person having the seizure is on their side in case they begin to throw up and choke.  During this phase Dad and I tend to favor one side and clench up while rapidly jerking our legs or knees. You should watch to make sure there is nothing around the person that could harm the person as well.

The 5 minute mark
After a few minutes this phase will generally slow and stop. If, and only if, the person’s seizure lasts longer than five minutes you need to call an ambulance immediately.  Next, the body calms down and this is also the time when Dad and I could lose control of our bladders. Slowly we will begin to return to consciousness and be able to understand where we are and recognize the people around us. I am ususally very dazed and out of it for quite a while. At this point, I tend to get very nauseous and will most likely vomit. This is normal.

My sister
Next, are the type of seizures that my sister, Meredith, suffers from. These are called absence seizures. This type of seizure usually appears in the form of staring off for extended periods of time. There are two types of absence seizures. One is simple absence and the seizures last a few seconds. The second is the type Meredith suffers from known as complex absence seizures which can last up to a minute  The problem with this type of seizure is that they can go undetected for months/years or even be misdiagnosed as ADD or disciplinary problems. When Meredith has these seizures in the first few moments usually the way we can tell what is happening is she makes a clicking noise almost with her mouth and the seizure is fairly short. Also, during this period some people notice excessive blinking, chewing, or walking around. If the person does walk around, make sure that they are not in a situation where they could hurt themselves.

Mom
Believe me, having this disease challenges us daily. But, I don’t think we could get through out it without the one member of our family that does not have this horrible disorder, my mother. Again, I thank you for being our rock. We love you!

I hope that I helped to answer questions you may have had. I know that it is scary to think of, but maybe just maybe you will be more prepared in the future if you are placed in a situation where someone is having a seizure.

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: Medikidz and LGS
 by Jessica Keenan Smith |  posted in: Blog Relay, Nov 16 EBR Posts |  0
This post is part of the Epilepsy Blog Relay™ which will run from November 1 through November 30, 2016. Follow along!

Disclaimer: This post was submitted by Eisai Inc., the Champion Level Sponsor of the November 2016 Epilepsy Blog Relay™.

The Medikidz Series
Talking about epilepsy with children is an extremely important, yet often difficult task. Parents of a child with epilepsy may find themselves having to explain epilepsy to their child with the condition, siblings and children of relatives and friends. Unfortunately, there is not an abundant number of educational resources for families seeking helpful information about epilepsy. Many years ago, Eisai recognized the gap in resources and supported the development of the “Medikidz Explain Epilepsy” series, which delivers engaging and age-appropriate educational materials to children who are living with the condition, so that they can better understand and explain their disease to others.

Medikidz is a company that develops comic books designed to help young people understand a variety of illnesses and medical concepts. Medikidz aims to provide accurate and relevant medical information through the use of the five Medikidz superheroes who provide a visually engaging and fun way to empower young people to understand medical information written for them by graphic novelists and leading clinical specialists.

The “Medikidz Explain Epilepsy” series launched its first book in 2013, which follows Jack on his journey through Mediland, where he learns all about epilepsy. The second book, “Medikidz Explain Seizure Assistance Dogs,” tells the story about Joel’s experience with his seizure-assistance dog, Flame. “Medikidz Explain Living With Epilepsy”, the third book, showcases how 16-year-old patient Megan quickly turned her diagnosis into an opportunity to advocate for, and inspire those, living with epilepsy through her vlog and social media network. The fourth book, “Medikidz Explain Playing Sports With Epilepsy” features Hannah who despite living with epilepsy, continues her life as an athlete.

Medikidz and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS)
The fifth and latest installment in the comic book series, “Medikidz Explain Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS),” is a story about a seven-year-old boy named Jackson who lives with LGS, a rare type of epilepsy that is usually characterized by multiple seizure types, cognitive impairment or developmental delays.1 The book tells Jackson’s story through the eyes of his younger sister, Tenley, and demonstrates how to explain LGS to siblings of those living with the disease, as well as others who may not understand how LGS may impact someone’s daily life.

This latest book was just launched at the LGS Foundation’s 2016 International LGS Awareness Day event, at the Port Discovery Children’s Museum in Baltimore. The event aimed to celebrate real-life superheroes: those living with LGS and their families. Jackson’s family and the Medikidz superheroes attended the event to hand out free copies of the new Medikidz book.

Since 2013, the Medikidz characters have traveled with the Eisai team to walks, conferences, and sporting events. Eisai and Medikidz are committed to providing information to help patients and their families better understand epilepsy and ultimately help reduce the stigma associated with this condition.

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: Update on epilepsy awareness initiatives
 by Jessica Keenan Smith |  posted in: #LivingWellChat, Blog Relay, Nov 16 EBR Posts |  0
This post is part of the Epilepsy Blog Relay™ which will run from November 1 through November 30, 2016. Follow along!

An update from Jessica
These days the Living Well With Epilepsy team is busy working on new epilepsy awareness initiatives. In October, the IAMSUDEPAWARE campaign skyrocketed beyond our expectations. Recently Emily Donoghue, a Living Well writer, presented at an Eisai UK event. Abby Gustus-Alford, a Living Well writer, released her new book, Seize the Day. This month we are busy with the Epilepsy Blog Relay which will end with the #LivingWellChat. And in December, I will head to the American Epilepsy Society meeting in Houston, TX.

Learn more about SUDEP
Last month Living Well With Epilepsy worked with SUDEP Aware and Lundbeck on an exciting new campaign to increase awareness of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). The #IAMSUDEPAWARE social media campaign was extremely successful in raising awareness. The effort kicked off September 23 and ran through October 23. As a result, more than a half a million people learned about SUDEP.

Just in case you missed it, here is a bit of info on SUDEP. Today, approximately 65 Million people around the world are living with epilepsy and each year, an estimated 1 in 1000 people with epilepsy die from Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). That’s approximately 65,000 people around the world who will die each year as a result of SUDEP. Download brochures on SUDEP in English Spanish and French from SUDEP Aware.

Don’t miss the #LivingWellChat
Join us for a fun LIVE event on November 30, at 7pm ET as a way to celebrate the end of another great Epilepsy Blog Relay™. We use the hashtag #LivingWellChat to filter out all the other social noise on the platform and the chat lasts about 1 hour.

How does the chat work?

Lots of Twitter chats have a formal structure, only allowing a few minutes per question, but #LivingWellChat is a bit more open. The format of #LivingWellChat is very simple: We start with a general topic, and the conversation flows from there. We encourage spontaneous discussion with tons of Q&A.

Participating in #LivingWellChat
1. Go to http://twubs.com/livingwellchat OR http://tweetchat.com/room/livingwellchat
2. Log in using your twitter account **IMPORTANT**
3. Set the chat speed as fast or slow as you prefer
4. The Twitter feed will pop up with all the #LivingWellChat tweets.
5. Be sure to introduce yourself when you come on the chat

I really like Twubs, but some people prefer Tweetchat. Others prefer to participate within Twitter. It’s up to you!

If you don’t have a twitter account

You won’t be able to chime in with your own comments but here are two ways to follow along:

Option 1: Go to the Living Well With Epilepsy Facebook page and click on the Twitter tab at https://www.facebook.com/livingwellwithepilepsy/app/294627540601598/

Option 2: Go to http://livingwellwithepilepsy.com and watch the chat in the footer of the home page.

Can anyone join in the conversation?
Yes, please join in the chat. Whether you have been living with epilepsy for decades, or if you are newly diagnosed, you and your loved ones will find something of interest on the next #LivingWellChat.

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: 5 Tips for Choosing a Safer Fitness Program with Epilepsy
 by Abby Gustus-Alford |  posted in: Blog Relay, Epilepsy and Fitness, Nov 16 EBR Posts |  0
This post is part of the Epilepsy Blog Relay™ which will run from November 1 through November 30, 2016. Follow along!

Abby’s Story
Wouldn’t it be nice to not worry about what sports to play and/or what activities to partake in?  I think it would!  That would be a luxury!  But, that’s just not a reality for those of us with epilepsy.  There are certain things that we need to think about when choosing a sport or fitness program.

Fitness and epilepsy
I grew up playing soccer.  I absolutely loved soccer.  To be honest, when I was in high school, my personal goal was to play in college.  I was already on a select team in St. Louis and the Missouri Olympic Development Team for my age group.  This was what I wanted to do.

However, high school was a rough time for me.  We, as a family, could not get my seizures under control.  We tried all different medicines, we tried stints in the EMU to see if brain surgery was an option (it was not), and we tried adopting overall healthy habits (getting enough sleep, eating healthy, etc).  Nothing worked.   I was still having seizures… often.

The physical nature of soccer and the head balls that I had to do in my position as a defender did not bode well for my health.   As a family, we were not as concerned with the physicality of soccer, we were concerned about the head balls.

Recently, my mom told me a story when I was writing my new book, Seize the Day, of a time during a game when I went up for a head ball against another girl near the goal.  Our heads hit and she said that you could hear the collision of our two heads from the stands.  She said it terrified her and that she was concerned the next seizure I had was because of that blow to my head.  It probably wasn’t in the end, but we can also never prove that it didn’t have a negative impact.

It was not long after that incident that my parents and I decided this sport was probably not good for my health.  It was time for me to find another passion and focus my energies elsewhere.  While I didn’t immediately find my fitness/activity passion at that time, I did (at that time) fall in love with student council and became the President of our senior class.  When one door shuts, another one always opens.

5 tips for safer fitness
With that, I’d like to offer a few words of wisdom about thoughtfully choosing a fitness program or physical activity to those living with epilepsy:

Be careful if it includes water sports or swimming.
Stay away from activities where you could get hurt.  Contact sports, where a head injury is possible, is probably one that should be carefully considered when a person is living with epilepsy.
It helps to have other people around you in case of emergency.  I’m not saying you always need somebody around, but have a backup plan if you are alone.
Tell somebody you love when to expect you back say from a long training run or bike ride.
Carry a medical card or jewelry that explains that you have epilepsy and what first aid you may or may not need.
These days, I focus on running, spinning, and group exercise classes.  As you can probably tell, it’s been a personal choice to stay away from contact sports.  But, luckily I can say I love running just as much as I always loved soccer!

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: Chantal on Epilepsy in Everyday Life
 by Jessica Keenan Smith |  posted in: Blog Relay, Nov 16 EBR Posts |  0
This post is part of the Epilepsy Blog Relay™ which will run from November 1 through November 30.  Follow along and add comments to posts that inspire you!

Chantal’s Story
Epilepsy in everday life, I think we all know it’s not always that easy. But you can make a difference in the perspective on how you look at being diagnosed with Epilepsy. And whether or not you let Epilepsy control your life.

Couple of months ago I wrote another blog, because I noticed some of my followers are from overseas.  I’m from The Netherlands, so my blogs are in Dutch. Feel free to read: Epilepsy | Electric Superpowers

As you might have read in my other blog I have a VNS, for almost a year now. The settings of my VNS were modified multiple times in the last couple of months. It’s still not really working for me yet, so my Epilepsy-counselor and I are still looking for the settings that will hopefully give the results we want!

If we find a setting that works, it will change my life! I still have 10-15 seizures a day. For those who are familiar with VNS, you know that it comes with a magnet. I have not had the chance to try it out as often as I want, to be sure it really works with the Tonic-Clonic seizures. But the times I have used it, it seemed to reduce the seizure a bit. Which is a good thing!

A letter to my epilepsy
I think it’s important to make ‘fun’ of Epilepsy. So my blogs contain humor, sarcasm and self-mockery. It sure helped me to accept all of this. I often write ‘letters’ to my Epilepsy, so I choose to do the same for this Epilepsy Blog Relay.

Dear Epilepsy,

You blew away several certainties in life. I am fighting this battle now for almost nineteen years. You force me deal with you every single day. But I won’t put the blame on you, you are just being you. Doing what you do best. But you, dear Epilepsy, should not take me for granted. Accepting you the way you behave, you should be thanking me for the way I treat you and deal with you.

I won’t lie to you that I sometimes really hate you. You have a lot of power, but it’s a waste of time. Because I not giving up to find a good combination with medication and the VNS that I got implanted specially for you, close to my heart. I will keep you company. And if I could I would wrap my arms around you. Instead of being in my brain with your electric superpowers, I would put you under my skin to keep you warm.

You have these sudden moves, but they don’t scare me anymore. So welcome to my life, accepting you for what you do.

It took me a while, but I have found a way to cope with your flaws. I embrassed you. I know that you are here to stay. But you, dear Epilepsy, never will have a hold on me.

With love,
Chantal

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: Leila on Navigating Health Insurance

Health Insurance and Epilepsy
Shopping for insurance can be overwhelming.  There are so many things to think about: drug formularies, whether a plan covers your doctors, co-payments, deductibles, the list goes on and on!  It’s absolutely possible to sort out all of these things without losing your mind, even if it doesn’t feel like it!  Read on for some tips to make your hunt for insurance a little easier.

Paying a Premium
Your premium is the amount you pay the insurance every month. This money is just to keep your insurance coverage.  It generally does not contribute to your deductible and does not pay for any medical services.

Co-Payment
This is the money you pay for medical services.  When you go to the doctor, have a test done, or any other medical service, you pay a set amount for it.  The amount you pay depends on your insurance plan.  Generally, the higher your monthly premium, the lower your payment for services. This is ideal for those of us who go to doctors frequently. If you don’t use services often, you may want to opt for a plan that has a lower monthly premium but higher cost of services.  If you’re able to choose your plan, calculate how often you go to the doctor to determine whether you want to pay a higher premium or higher co-payments.

What is a deductible?
A deductible is the amount of money you must pay before the insurance company begins to pay. If the deductible is $1000, for example, then you will pay $1000 for medical services before the insurance company pays any.  Some insurance companies pay for services before the deductible is met.  Look to see if this is the case; it can save you money! Check and see if the money you pay for your prescriptions goes towards your deductible.  With my previous insurance, my prescriptions did not go to my deductible. If my deductible was $1000, this meant that I still had to pay $1000 before insurance would take over payment for services. If you are purchasing prescriptions often, it can be a benefit to have those funds go towards your deductible.  Always check to see if the plan has more than one deductible.  I haven’t seen many of these, but some have separate deductibles for medical services and prescriptions.  If you have a family, look to see if there is a family and individual deductible.  Some plans have deductibles that apply to each person and another deductible that applies to the family.  For example, a personal deductible may be $1000 before insurance kicks in, while a family deductible may be $2000 and all payments made by members of the family contribute to it.  If the combined members of the family hits $2000 before an individual hits $1000, the insurance will begin to cover costs.

Drug Formularies
Always make sure your medication is covered under your insurance plan.  Look for the plan’s drug formulary which lists the medications covered and the amount they will pay for.  Some companies have different tiers to classify drugs and, depending on the medication, they will cover certain amounts based on the tiers.  Check your medicine with each specific plan, not just with each insurance company, to make sure you’re covered. It may not be, and you’ll have to talk with your doctor about switching medications.  If you’re on a drug that has different variations, like Keppra vs. Keppra ER, you need to see if your specific version is covered.  At one point in my life, Keppra ER wasn’t covered but Keppra was.  

In some cases, the generic form of your pill will be covered or it will be cheaper than the name brand. With my previous insurance, Keppra wasn’t covered, but it’s generic form was. Always talk with your doctor about your medications and what your options are to find one that is covered. Never switch to another medication without talking to your doctor.  On a related note, make sure your pill size is covered.  I was on a medication where the 25 mg and 50 mg tablets were covered but the 75 mg was not; I had to take two pills instead of one just because of it!

Doctor Coverage
Each plan varies on the doctors that are covered.  Sometimes they are the same across one insurance company, sometimes they aren’t. Just like your prescriptions, make sure to check if all of your doctors are covered. If you have a provider that isn’t covered, check with his/her office to see how much it costs to go to this doctor out-of-pocket.  It may not be much more to pay for an appointment without insurance.  You can also prioritize your doctors.  For example, you probably need the specialists you go to but, if you don’t go to the podiatrist every year, it won’t be as serious if he/she isn’t covered on your plan. (Note: You should attend all your medical appointments as often as they recommend. Do not stop going to a doctor unless you have consulted with him/her.)  Different doctors have different costs (specialists sometimes have higher co-pays), so make note of that when calculating your annual medical costs with each plan.

Odds & Ends
Some insurance companies prefer you to use specific pharmacies.  In my case, it is a better deal to use a mail order pharmacy as opposed to a store (CVS, Walgreens, etc).  My insurance company covers more of the cost that way.  See if your insurance does something similar. 

Always talk with your doctor about your different concerns.  If you have questions about specific insurance plans, contact that company. They’ll know how to answer your question based off of their policies.  Do your research, take notes, ask questions, and try to stay calm.  It can be overwhelming and frustrating to navigate insurance but when you know exactly what you need and how to find it, you’ll be sure to conquer the world of health insurance!

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: My Son is #MyEpilepsyHero
 by Jessica Keenan Smith |  posted in: Blog Relay, Nov 16 EBR Posts |  0
myepilepsyhero_facebookheroimage_eventpage

This post is part of the Epilepsy Blog Relay™, which will run from November 1 to November 30, 2016. Follow along!

This blog post was submitted by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., the Founding Sponsor of the November 2016 Epilepsy Blog Relay. Greg received compensation from Sunovion for this post.

Greg’s Story
My family’s life forever changed 13 years ago when my son Jake, now 20, was diagnosed with epilepsy. Before the diagnosis we noticed Jake would have staring spells where we thought he was just ignoring us, but we had no idea they were actually seizures. We had no concept of what epilepsy was when the doctor first made the diagnosis. Luckily, our doctor did a good job of explaining the specifics of the condition and the types of seizures Jake was having, but the journey ahead of us seemed overwhelming.

The years of pushing and persevering to find the right medication, the right dosing, the right balance and the right doctor was and continues to be daunting – for myself, my family and undoubtedly for Jake.

Jake will be the first to admit there are great days and there are not so great days. Today, we are grateful that the good days outnumber the bad. But it’s Jake’s determination in the face of setbacks that makes him #MyEpilepsyHero.

I will never forget the time Jake played in a baseball game and we saw him get a great hit – he really crushed that ball. He started running, rounded first base, rounded second base, but when he got to third base he had a seizure right there. We ran down to the field, got Jake and took him home. He was quiet throughout the car ride but once we got home, he came running out of the house and insisted we go back so he could finish the game.

Jake’s resilience and perseverance is extraordinary. He’s not going to settle until he gets his seizures under control and neither are we. He reminds us that we have to keep pushing and keep getting back into the game after setbacks. I couldn’t be more proud of him.

#MyEpilepsyHero
My son is my hero, but he’s not the only hero in the epilepsy community. There are millions of people across the country dealing with seizures and epilepsy. As my son has showed our family, epilepsy is not something to be ashamed of or hide from. That’s why I’ve teamed up with the Epilepsy Foundation and Sunovion Pharmaceuticals on #MyEpilepsyHero, because I think it’s really important that we stop for a second and celebrate the heroes in the world of epilepsy. We’re encouraging people impacted by epilepsy to recognize those who have made a positive difference in their lives by posting details about their heroes on social media along with #MyEpilepsyHero. Visit Sunovion’s Facebook page to learn more and nominate your epilepsy hero!

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: A new frame of reference
 by Eric Gerlach |  posted in: Blog Relay, Nov 16 EBR Posts |  0
eg-headshotThis post is part of the Epilepsy Blog Relay™ which will run from November 1 through November 30. Follow along and add comments to posts that inspire you!

Eric’s Story
At 42, I had my life completely together, working in technology, making a good deal of money, 1 kid in college, another about to go and a third just starting high school. My wife works at the high school all three kids were at, lots of colleagues, friends and several hobbies, all in all a good life. Earlier this year, I had a grand mal that put me in the hospital, there had been warning signs, but because we did not know what to look for, it came as a huge surprise.

The epilepsy diagnosis came as a shock, my being drug resistant was an even bigger shock. The neuro telling me I had probably had epilepsy since infancy was a huge shock. The biggest shock came from the VNS (inside epilepsy joke). I have a cardio problem that compounds the epilepsy problem as well.

I have not reached the 18 month mark post VNS insertion yet, however, the neuro and the cardio docs are already concerned, my seizure activity has gone up 300% for several months now. The neuro discussed SUDEP for the first time this month, I had to sit the family down and explain what that meant which was a difficult conversation for my 15 year old. All of this is the downside.

A new frame of reference
On the upside is a bunch of stuff I never would have expected. My friends rallied around me in a way I NEVER would have expected. They also made jokes like getting me to stir their drinks when I had a seizure (goofballs). I received support from people I haven’t talked to in over a decade. I have had people who don’t know me express concern, tell me they are praying for me, and bring us food, as simple expressions of kindness.

At first, I was embarrassed, especially after that first grand mal in the middle of church. I was mad at myself and humiliated. But also humbled at how concerned people I don’t even know were and how my friends made sure to cover everything and keep most of them at bay. I assumed at first it was just pity, but the more people I have shared my story with, the more I learn that most people are genuinely interested in the problem and don’t pity me but do feel some amount of concern or empathy.

In addition, I have had conversations with so many males with chronic illnesses. I would have never had these discussions if not for the epilepsy. I have found out that we are not doing a great job with chronic illnesses in this country period but males especially seem to just try to ignore it or suffer in silence. I at first thought I was just pathetic or weak for having seizures or being in pain. I realize that there are so many people who are either a similar or the exact same boat. I am starting an initiative in my community to get people talking about their struggle and know they aren’t alone.

I don’t know where this is going to take me, I don’t even know how much better or worse the epilepsy will get and that’s okay. There are days where I am so tired I can barely get out of bed or days where my brain is on fire. But I am not depressed about it anymore because I accepted what is happening to me, my new frame of reference, and now, each day is an opportunity to see if I can make it count.

Leila’s Ideas: Volunteer Match
 by Leila Zorzie |  posted in: Leila's Ideas |  0
Volunteering as a camp counselor--I do it every summer!
Volunteering as a camp counselor–I do it every summer!
There are so many people who have helped me in my epilepsy journey.  Whether they’re friends, family, or organizations, I am beyond thankful for those who have spent time with me on this crazy ride.  I want to volunteer with others just like I was helped, but there are so many ways to do so!  Emily wrote about a few of them in her post earlier this month.

 

Volunteer Match
While I was trying to determine what path of volunteering would be right for me, I stumbled upon a helpful website.  It’s called Volunteer Match and it is a giant hub of information about over 100,000 organizations for anyone looking to volunteer.

 

When you arrive at the home page, you are given the ability to search for volunteer opportunities in your geographical area.  You can also narrow the search based on your specific interests using 29 cause categories.  I could also search using the age group I want to work with.  I made my own profile so I can save my interests for future searches.  WIth my profile, I was also able to add a resume, save my location, and add special skills I have. I can choose between local opportunities to do in person or I can select a virtual opportunity to find ways to help someone across the country.  In my area, there were 67 volunteer opportunities!

 

The website offers resources for organization leaders and volunteers. The resources include webinars, books, videos, and a blog that can help volunteers make the most of their time and promote a positive culture within the organization.  

 

Choose Something Meaningful to You
Using this website helped me find organizations in my area that I didn’t even know could use my help.  Even if they’re not related to epilepsy, I can still use my experience to help others make the most of their lives.  With so many options, it can be hard to choose exactly which nonprofit to work with!  Regardless of which one is chosen, it will be a worthy cause.  If you’re motivated to give back to your community, check out Volunteer Match; it can connect you to a cause that can change your community for the better.

 

How have you helped out in your community?  Let us know in the comments below!

Emily’s Perspective: Giving Back
 by Emily Donoghue |  posted in: Emily's Perspective |  0
AwardIn 2006 I was diagnosed with Epilepsy. At the time I was confused; we all were. I have written quite a bit about my general experience but basically, I grew to adapt to my seizures and new lifestyle and I just got on with my life. I was nearly 11 and I got used to not being able to do what my friends could do, I got used to medications and it was all OK. It was as I got older that things got harder, my seizures got worse, and I was very isolated. This was when I decided I wanted to give back others and become a voice for Epilepsy. I wanted to show that it is OK to accept help and there are ways to live well with conditions.

 

It takes a lot of energy to make someone else feel bad, and in the end, you only feel good for a little while. When you make someone else feel happy, not only are you happy too, but that feeling lasts much longer. 

 

I have had numerous amounts of people come to me to ask how they can make a difference in their community, as well as people coming forward to tell me how I help them. I will never forget what a lady told me once; “People may forget what you said or what you did, but they will never forget how you made them feel.”  Everyone needs help at some point in his or her life. Everyone also has the ability to give back in someway or another.

 

Why help?
There are so many individuals, families and organisations out there that need your help, and it is possible for one person to make a big difference. For a year or so I was in a very dark place due to feeling so isolated and helpless, but I soon realised, after setting up a blog, that I felt much better after helping just one person. Doing good makes you feel good. Giving also connects us to others, creating stronger communities and helping to build a happier society for everyone. And it’s not all about money – we can also give our time, ideas and energy. Doing things for others – no matter how small, whether it is a random act of kindness, regular volunteering, fundraising – it is all a powerful way to boost our own happiness as well of those around us.

 

What can you do to help?
The first simple thing I can say is ‘Smile and be friendly’. I know this can be hard to do if you feel sad yourself, but a simple little thing like this can put a smile and warm feeling in someone else’s heart, and make their day a little better. They might then do the same for others!  

The second piece of advice I have is for you to ‘Call a charity to volunteer’. You may not have a local charity that you feel confident in volunteering for (I am confident in Epilepsy and associated conditions but found it hard to find a charity in my town), but you don’t have to live locally to them. You also don’t have to go to meet ups every day. Do a bit of research, get their number or email address and make the first step. It can be whatever charity you like. Volunteering is one of the most amazing things you can do. I work for Young Epilepsy and have also worked closely with Epilepsy Action, both of which are pretty far away from my town!

Make a donation. There are lots of ways to donate to charities online, or in your local community. Instead of buying yourself a new outfit or a pair of shoes, spend that money in a more positive way. I have made cakes, cards, sold my artwork and taken part in events and ran campaigns to raise money and to make donations to my chosen charity.

One of my biggest tips in relation to Epilepsy is to Teach. Take the time to teach someone a skill or some information you know. This could be teaching your friends about Epilepsy and seizures, teaching your colleagues Epilepsy first aid, or what different seizures can look like.

Help someone take action. If someone you know or someone you have met through blogs or websites seems to be lost and doesn’t know what to do, help them do something. Help them find the right helpline, comfort them in times of need, and reach out to someone more professional who could help them. Obviously don’t do it all yourself — let them take action too, because it helps in the process, but just give them that extra push.

How about you just lend your ear. Often someone who is sad, depressed, angry, or frustrated just needs someone who will listen!

Send a nice email. Sounds a little silly maybe, but I send an email a day to some of my readers and Epilepsy connections, just a quick note to ask how they are, or how proud you are of them for being so strong, or just saying hello! It might be the only message they get today.

Show appreciation, publicly. Praising someone on a blog, in front of coworkers, in front of family, or in some other public way, is a great way to make them feel better about themselves. At the Epilepsy awards in London in May this year, I tried to thank everyone for their support but I was in so much shock that it didn’t sound so great, but I sent out a huge thank you message and video across the internet just so people knew how truly thankful I am for everyone’s support on my journey!

One of my big pieces of advice is to lend your voice. Often people in the world need someone to speak up for them, or someone to give them a helping hand. It also helps people out there who feel alone and therefore don’t want to speak up. You don’t have to take all that on alone of course. You can join a group of people, campaigners etc. in speaking up at a council meeting, an event, writing letters, and otherwise making a need heard.

I am speaking at an event being held in Hatfield on the 1st November 2016. I am so nervous but I know it’ll make a difference. Make your voice be heard!

 

Do you like the idea of being heard? The idea of giving back and helping others?
If you would like some advice on who to contact in your area, or if you like the idea on taking on some challenges-comment below. We’d love to help you.

Eliza’s Story: Finding moments of strength
 by Eliza |  posted in: Personal Stories |  3
life-is-tough-my-darlingThis personal story was submitted by Eliza. I hope you enjoy learning about her experience. 

Eliza’s Story
I stumbled across this quote last week, which is quite timely as I approach the two-year anniversary of my first grand mal seizure. I’ve learned so much and changed in innumerable ways in such a relatively short period of time. When you’re dealing with a diagnosis of a new illness, they say that’s often what happens. Your life gets turned upside down. And then what? How do you learn to live in your new upside down life, where things are vaguely recognizable and nothing is really the same?

Sometimes, I feel like I’ve conquered the chronic illness world and have truly, gracefully grown into my new self. In those moments, I feel reflective, together, connected, and very much at peace with my reality. I’ve pinpointed a number of specific moments that make me feel this sense of growth and accomplishment.

Moments of strength
One occurs when I’m out with friends on the weekends. I can say honestly that it does not bother me to be around people who are drinking when I am entirely sober. When I think about where I started in this department soon after I stopped drinking due to my epilepsy, I can’t believe I’ve made it this far. I used to be bitter, resentful, and jealous. I particularly didn’t enjoy engaging in conversations like this one:

“You’re not drinking? Me neither. I’m on a two week cleanse. It’s so tough.”

The choice associated with sobriety in a cleanse distantly mocks my own sobriety. The risk that I run is too high because alcohol lowers the brain’s seizure threshold, and when I first started figuring this whole chronic illness thing out, statements like these would press a particularly sensitive button in me. Don’t get me wrong – people still make comments like this all the time. But now, I feel so much more confident articulating my experience and perspective, or if I can’t fell the button pressed at all, I smile and say, “That is SO tough.”

Moments of serenity
Another one of these serene moments comes when I tell someone new that I have epilepsy. Often times, these experiences are connected to the aforementioned alcohol situation, because how weird is it for a 27 year old to never drink ever? Apparently, weird enough for people to notice. I used to fumble through this conversation feeling a lovely mixture of embarrassed, shame and feeling of being exposed, all due to my perceived stigma associated with having seizures and epilepsy. Although there isn’t much I can do to prevent my brain from randomly firing abnormal electrical activity to cause a seizure, the concept of sharing such a personal, physically vulnerable moment with a new person caused me great stress.

In her book Daring Greatly, Brené Brown discusses how one way to live a wholehearted life is to be vulnerable with people in your life who earn it. I’ve thought a lot about the idea of who earns the right to know about my epilepsy, and when I do decide to be vulnerable with that important information and share it with someone else, it’s because I’ve determined that they earned it. I trust you, and you deserve this information in order to understand me better. This, in addition to time, has helped me acquire more grace in this arena.

Moments of anxiety
There are other moments, however, where I feel none of those wonderful, positive emotions. Anxiety levels rise rapidly, peace shatters around me, and I can’t imagine how I ever felt like this was something I could live with forever.

It is in these moments that I remember the true meaning of chronic. Epilepsy is a constant in my life now. I have been extremely lucky to be seizure free for a year and 9 months, but doesn’t mean it isn’t with me every single day. If I had another seizure later today or tomorrow, then would all of the stigma and shame come flooding back in? I wouldn’t be able to drive again for three months, a legal consequence for having a seizure while medicated according to Texas state law. This happened after my second seizure, and it felt like my legs had been cut off at the knees. Independence is a true prized possession in my life, and one that easily slips away after a seizure. Living in a city with limited public transportation and no Uber makes the thought of not being able to drive difficult to internalize.

Often times, I think about it, feel it, re-live it, or talk about it multiple times a day. Every time I get in my car, a wave of fear washes over me. Sometimes it’s larger than others, but it’s always a conscious thought as I get in the driver’s side of a car. My second seizure happened when I was driving, so this fear is amplified by experience.

Moments of fear
I also experience a spike in fear when I don’t feel well. With every headache, anxiety begins to mount. Every time I can’t sleep, I get nervous. I also know that it’s a cycle, and the more stressed out and anxious I am about a headache or lack of sleep, the more likely I am to have a seizure. So the cycle continues. This cycle has led me in some interesting and scary directions. Once, pretty recently, I had a panic attack in the middle of a coffee shop while doing my grad school homework on a Saturday morning. I was convinced I was having a seizure aura, so I googled it just to be sure. WebMD confirmed, so I called my mom, who directed me to call my primary care physician. My doctor, who is a godsend and a close friend, answered his phone before 10am on Saturday morning and instructed me via phone how to take my pulse. He essentially determined that my blood sugar was low and I needed to eat, and assured me that I was going to be fine. By that time, my mom had arrived at the coffee shop after bolting out of the gym (mid-workout) and flying across town to make sure I was okay.

I can look back on this coffee shop incident now with some amusement and remind myself never to google medical symptoms in moments of panic, but this is also a great example of the burden that my parents and my close friends bare in my chronic illness.

Moments of compassion
I’ve noticed that some months I’ve had more success facing my reality with honesty and courage, and it all depends on how much compassion I have with myself.

Leila’s Ideas: Don’t Give Up on Your Dreams
 by Leila Zorzie |  posted in: Leila's Ideas |  0
SMART GOAL LADDERWhat is your dream?  Do you long to be a teacher, a lawyer, an astronaut?  Are you inspired by creating things, helping people, or science?  We all have goals and dreams we want to achieve.  Sometimes, having seizures makes it seem like those dreams won’t come true.  If you need some inspiration, I’ve found 2 ladies who can do just that.

 

Kelly Marie Falk
Falk competed on America’s Next Top Model during its twelfth season.  Along with modeling skills, Falk has epilepsy.  She was certain that having a diagnosis would not hold her back.  She was asked in an interview if she felt that epilepsy would be a hindrance. She replied by saying “…my epilepsy should never be a hindrance to me.”  

 

Even though runways typically used strobe lights during fashion shows, she confidently carried herself and her seizures did not make an appearance.  How awesome!  It’s inspiring to read that someone is still going after their biggest dreams even with a diagnosis. She even has a page dedicated to epilepsy awareness on her website!

 

Kathy Sierra
Sierra is a co-creator of the series of books Head First, which are meant to teach people about computer topics.  She has won a Product Excellence Jolt Award and has contributed to the programming of many computer games.  In an honest and open post, she writes about how scary having a seizure can be.  Ultimately, she muses, “…I also hope that I never forget to live each day the way I vowed I would…”  That is powerful!

 

Dare to Dream
Seizures can knock us off of our game and make us feel helpless.  We cannot forget that we have a life to live that does not have to be consumed by seizures.  We have goals to set, dreams to achieve, and adventures in front of us!  Never be so consumed by your seizures that you forget to find inspiration in each day.

 

Your Turn
Who inspires you?  How do you make sure epilepsy never overpowers your dreams of the future?  Let us know in the comments or submit your story today.

Stephen’s Story: Reducing my medication
 by Stephen Bianchi |  posted in: Personal Stories |  2
IMG_8941This personal story was submitted by Stephen. He is living with epilepsy and was inspired to submit his story because of a recent personal story. I hope you enjoy learning about Stephen’s experience. 

I have read more and more recently about Epileptic symptoms which have been misdiagnosed, in certain cases actually being psychosomatic. However, my EEG was apparently conclusive, and according to the specialist I have Epilepsy. I wish it was not the case, but I appear to be stuck with it. I know that everyone’s Epilepsy is very personal and often it is very difficult to compare so I am asking how do any of us go about understanding the nature of what is afflicting us?

Stephanie’s inspiring story
Stephanie’s story was inspirational as it did offer a glimpse into something that challenged what seems impossible. I am on one medication and as far as I can see it has made no difference. My Epilepsy started four years ago and although my seizures are very intermittent they usually hospitalize me and despite the anticonvulsant medication dose I take (they keep on increasing it), the seizures are just as they ever were; for this reason I may as well not be taking it.

I am of course aware of the dangers of stopping your medication but I hoped that there maybe some insight out there on how to gradually reduce my dose safely. I think stress was what originally brought my seizures on, something which I know I have now for the most part conquered. It is my belief however, that it is my occasional lapse in taking medication that is now causing the seizures.

This I feel is ironic and is very much the cure being worse than the illness. I understand that there are a lot of very good doctors out there but it is the everyday people who suffer with this awful illness that are best placed to comment as we are the ones who are effected on a daily basis. I want fight this thing on my own terms. Where do I start?

Emily’s Perspective: Coping Styles
 by Emily Donoghue |  posted in: Emily's Perspective |  2
Coping StylesEpilepsy is a neurological disorder that causes nerve cells in the brain to become disrupted, resulting in seizures.

When somebody is first diagnosed with a condition, family members experience a whole range of feelings. The experience of witnessing your child’s first seizure, a family member’s seizure or a friend/work colleague’s seizure can be devastating and scary. It is important to find the coping styles that works for you and your family when you deal with all of these feelings.

Reacting to a Diagnosis
People react to situations in many different ways. A parent’s reaction to their child’s diagnosis could be:

Anger, shock, denial: Why my child? Why our family? This can’t be true.
Confusion: What is epilepsy? What is causing my child’s epilepsy? Will my child have more seizures? What are medication side effects?
Sadness: I want to be able to fix this or make it go away, but I can’t.
Guilt: Why didn’t we notice something earlier? What did we do wrong? Is there something I did to cause this?
Fear and worry: What does this mean for my child’s life and future?
Anxiety and frustration: Parents may feel anxious and frustrated because of the unpredictable nature of the seizures
Hope: Most parents express a hope that the seizures are only temporary, or that the seizures will be controlled
In general, the diagnosis of epilepsy, and the associated learning and/or psychosocial difficulties that may accompany epilepsy, present new challenges for parents and children as they attempt to adjust to the diagnosis and develop coping strategies that will assist them in living with epilepsy.

My Coping Experience
Over the years I have noticed that my family and I have experienced different emotions at different times of my diagnosis as we have learnt more about my condition. Talking about them, learning to manage them, and getting our questions answered all contributed to an important part of adapting and learning to cope with epilepsy.  I found different types of treatment over the years to help me cope with my condition such as CBT (Cognitive Behavior Therapy) and support networking teams that can give support.  By learning more about a condition, you can find better ways to cope. An individual may have questions, or may not want to think or talk about the diagnosis, but there are ways to cope with that.

Tips to Stay Healthy
One of my top tips to readers is that understanding your condition can help you control it. Understand what is important to your health:

Take your medication correctly
I recommend having a pill box dated ‘Monday-Friday’ to help you or your child to remember to take the prescribed medicine. I used to struggle with forgetting my pills so investing in a pot really did help. If you struggle to get your medications on time, speak to your GP and see if you can get your prescriptions delivered to you to make it less stressful for you.
Get enough sleep
Did you know that some people have their first and only seizures after an “all-nighter” or after not sleeping well for long periods? If you have epilepsy, lack of quality sleep makes most people more likely to have seizures. It can even increase the intensity and length of seizures. If sleep is a problem for you and, if like me, you are more prone to seizures if you are tired, then I advise you monitor your sleeping patterns and habits. Keep a little diary of what time you go to bed, what time you get up, and how you feel in the morning. Before bed, turn off TVs, computers, and other blue-light sources before you go to bed.
Wear a medical alert bracelet
Medical alert jewelry is a must have in my opinion, but some people don’t like the idea of it-but you really can get some lovely alert jewelry suitable for everyone. I wrote a review a while back about an ID square that is a great piece of kit.  Owning some alert jewelry helps people you are with and medical professionals know about you and your condition. It can save your life.
Educate yourself
Last but not least-Have a look at educating yourself and your friends and family about epilepsy so that they understand the condition. Use appropriate coping styles to stay healthy.  Try to ignore negative reactions from people. Live as independently as possible and try not to constantly worry about having a seizure.
We are here for you
Living Well With Epilepsy and the entire epilepsy community are here for you.  It can help to find an epilepsy support group where you can meet people who understand what you’re going through whether it is online or in person. Just look at me, blogging changed my life!

Faye’s take on Juice Plus+: Too Good to be True?
 by Guest Contributor |  posted in: Guest Posts |  0
Eat fruits every dayFaye, a 30-something from London and frequent contributor to Living Well With Epilepsy’s Epilepsy Blog Relay, recently published an article on her blog FairyFaye1986. She has allowed us to share an excerpt of the post here:

Faye’s take on Juice Plus+
Juice Plus+ is the latest craze in the UK, although the company has actually been established for many years. What started as a small direct sales business has now become a successful, global company that helps people live a better life in more than 20 countries. They aim to inspire people to lead a healthier and better life all over the world! In 2013 they celebrated their 20th anniversary.  It works with individuals’ reps selling the pills and shakes that the company say will lead you to a healthier lifestyle.

I have been gritting my teeth of late as I have watched sales rep after sales rep claim that Juice Plus+ can help medical conditions, gain world peace, solve world hunger and stop natural disasters (okay, the last few bits may be an exaggeration on my part but that’s what it feels like). I have watched time and time again as these reps with no (or very little) medical knowledge claim this product is safe for those with epilepsy, that it can or is proven to help or decrease your seizures, safe for those who are pregnant, and can help a number of other medical conditions. Really????

Before I start let me just say that this is in no way an attack on Juice Plus+ as a company or the product itself; they have been efficient in answering my questions and are clearly taking steps to deal with the sales reps and have treated my concerns seriously from the beginning. My issue is with the bad sales reps, the ones who give the company a bad name. There are some very good ones out there: ones I have come across who have product knowledge, are well aware of the benefits and limitations of Juice Plus+ and know exactly where the company stands on medical conditions, I have also highlighted the reps that do a good job to Juice Plus+.

Read the full article

Stephanie’s Story: Beating the Seizures
 by Stephanie J Schlosser |  posted in: Personal Stories |  0
StephanieThis personal story was submitted by Stephanie who is living with epilepsy and now feels she is not alone thanks in part to your stories. I hope you enjoy learning about Stephanie’s experience. 

Stephanie’s Story
For five years I have been hospitalized mutliple times with multiple diagnosis, all now reversed. Through this process one smart doctor chose to put me on divalproex, otherwise known as valproate, because he saw me have large kinetic movement, or jerking. Finally after a week on it, I experienced relief from strange symptoms that I’d had for over twenty years.

My naturopathic physician, who also has training in pharmacology began to wonder, do I really have epilepsy? I asked to see a neurologist, waiting for 6 months with still no appointment in site, I gave up on the doctors and started my own treatment plan. I’m happy to say I haven’t had any major seizures or hospitalizations since and I have been able to reduce my divalproex and keep it at a steady dose.

Thank goodness for all the information all over the internet. In this time, my son who had weird illness, undiagnosed as well, started to have some major jerking seizure type activity. After multiple neurologist visits, they still didn’t know for sure what it was because his EEG’s were negative. We had video and could tell the doctors the anti-seizure medicine worked for me, but they didn’t want to turn him into a zombie. So, that was that, time for mom to go full guns and get my kid fixed.

Beating the Seizures
I spent months reading and contacting experts and learning as much as possible. My son’s seizures are now very infrequent, short and tiny and getting better every day. Please don’t listen to anyone that tells you to do one therapy at a time, its ridiculous old advice. Our treatment plan includes a ketogenic diet (20-40 grams/carb)- not as severe as some, supplements including zinc, selenium, black seed oil, seabuckthorn oil, lion’s mane (memory), and therapeutic ketones (contact me on Instagram or Twitter for brands). We’ve also used Bowen Therapy with an Registered Masage Therapist (amazing, couldn’t say enough about how good it is for your central nervous system). And we use MCT oil right before bed to keep the brain fed and insulated.

Do whatever it takes for you on your journey and best wishes to everyone.

Epilepsy and Fitness: Choosing a Charity and Giving Back
 by Abby Gustus-Alford |  posted in: Epilepsy and Fitness |  0
Girls on the Run 5k!
Girls on the Run 5k
Living with epilepsy has taught me that there are many different organizations around to support both those living with the disorder, as well as friends and family affected by it.  Each organization is supported with volunteers who care deeply about the cause.

After utilizing these resources my whole life, I decided that I wanted to pay it forward and begin giving back to the community also.  So many people helped me along the way, especially the Epilepsy Foundation, that it was time for me to help others as well.

 

Choosing the Charity
I am passionate about helping people with epilepsy, and in fact, I volunteer often for those organizations, however I decided a long time ago that I wanted to also help another cause.  I researched organizations in the Greater Houston area that focused on health, fitness, running, and exercise.  That led me to an organization I fell in love with called Girls on the Run Greater Houston.

This purpose of the semester long program for girls in 3rd through 5th grade is to help them “develop and improve competence, feel confidence in who they are, develop strength of character, respond to others and oneself with care and compassion, create positive connections with peers and adults, and make a meaningful contribution to community and society.”  The program also has an emphasis on running, which is what drew me to it in the first place.  The girls in the program slowly train all semester for a 5K.  By the end of the semester, the organization hosts a 5K run for both the girls and the public.  I love the message of the organization and it pairs well with my passion for fitness and health.  

Abby Race Day

Paying it Forward
I’m a huge advocate of giving back to your community.  After all, so many people have helped me along my epilepsy journey; I feel that giving back a little of my time, now that I am independent and able, is one small way to say thank you to the many people who helped me.

That said, I decided this year to run alongside the girls in the 5K.  I have been focused on group classes lately, so a few weeks ago knowing this race was coming up, I followed “loosely” a quick couch to 5K program so that I would not feel too sore the next day!   It worked.  The event was a success, my race time was not terrible, and my heart was happy that I donated my time and effort giving back to such an amazing cause!

Leila’s Ideas: Back to School with Epilepsy
 by Leila Zorzie |  posted in: Leila's Ideas |  2
Classrooms are ready to be full of students, ready to learn and succeed!
Classrooms are ready to be full of students, ready to learn and succeed!
It’s that time of year again!  The family vacations have ended, pencils and notebooks have been purchased, and clothes are picked out for the first day of school.  Kids all over the country are going back to school and, for many, it is exciting!  Back to school may mean homework, but it also means chatting with old friends, beginning extracurricular activities again, and finding new adventures to make memories from.  For students with epilepsy, going back to school can be more complicated.  I’ve outlined a few speed bumps those of us with epilepsy may encounter when starting school and how to handle them.

 

Explaining Epilepsy…Again
Sometimes school personnel have been taught and trained to understand and respond to seizures.  Unfortunately, not all educators are so lucky.  Before school begins, it is good to find out who your (or your child’s) teacher will be and explain epilepsy to him or her.  My mom always wrote my teachers a letter and took it in to a meeting before school began.  That way, teachers had documentation to refer back to if they had any questions about my seizures and they also had a chance during the meeting to get answers to any questions or concerns they had.  I always had the option of going to the meeting with my mom and, once I became more comfortable with my diagnosis, I began attending and participating in them.  It was a great way to foster a relationship with my teacher as well as calm any fears I had about being in school again.

 

Meet the Nurse
Every school is different; some have one nurse for each building in a district, while others have one nurse to cover everyone.  Whether you have known your school nurse for years or you’re entering a new school with a new nurse, it is essential to talk to him/her.  While it is not necessary to meet with the nurse, it can be helpful.  A nurse is trained in the health field, so he/she should know more about epilepsy.  You can talk to the nurse about your specific needs and how to respond to your type of seizure.  While there are general rules for responding to a seizure, each person is different and it’s important that you or your child get the care that you need.

 

Accommodations
When I was in school, I had special accommodations to help me be successful.  To get these, I went through testing and had a document called an IEP (Individualized Education Plan) that outlined what help I was allowed.  My parents and I met with a school psychologist, the guidance counselor, the principal, and teachers to make sure everyone was on the same page.  Check with your school district to find out what is required for an IEP, a 504, or any other accommodations to help you or your child to be successful.

 

Stick to a Schedule
Eating right, exercising, and getting enough sleep are essential to everyone’s health.  It is even more important for those of us with epilepsy.  Make sure to get yourself back into a routine full of sleep, balanced meals, and stress relief.  All of these things not only help your body function normally but they also keep your brain working!  Don’t get so busy that you and your child forget to take care of yourself. Parents: this goes for you, too!

 

Beginning a new school year should be exciting and filled with fun!  Don’t allow epilepsy to steal that joy from you and your child.  Find out what it will take for you or your student to be successful.  That may be extra help in school, a specific bed time, or taking a walk every night.  You know your body best and what you need to stay healthy.  Don’t forget to have fun!  Enjoy all the activities that come with the school year.

 

What are some things that you make sure to do every school year?  How do you make yourself (or your child) successful?  Help each other in the comments below!

Emily’s Perspective: My Family’s Epilepsy Experience
 by Emily Donoghue |  posted in: Emily's Perspective |  1
Emily's Family

 

My Family’s Epilepsy Experience
I was diagnosed in 2006, although looking back at home videos and reminiscing, we do think I was having seizures at a younger age. My diagnosis had a huge impact on family life. Coping with my own emotions as well as my family coping too, was hard, although nobody said it would be easy.

When someone is diagnosed with epilepsy, no matter what their age, they may experience a whole range of emotions but so will their family and friends. My parents and siblings experienced sadness and my Nan, to this day, says she feels guilty for all the times she grumbled at me for not listening or all the times I nearly got struck by speeding vehicles as I stopped in the middle of the road. For a while I blamed myself though I don’t know why. It wasn’t as if I was deliberately blacking out during class or deliberately avoiding social situations, it just happened. I have learned over time that all these emotions are perfectly normal and part of an adjustment process. Still, it was one of the toughest processes I have ever had to deal with.

Mum’s hopes and aspirations for me needed to be adjusted. I wouldn’t be able to drive if my seizures carried on; I would have to be seizure free for some time. I couldn’t go out celebrating occasions with my friends in clubs as I got older, and I was a very lonely child-not what the Doctor ordered that’s for sure. Looking back, I can advise both parents and patients to not be afraid to get help for yourself from your own GP if you need it. I want to help people who are new to epilepsy, as well as those who have lived with it for a long time like myself. Your epilepsy specialist nurse understands what you are going through and will also be able to provide support.

I was provided counseling, CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) sessions, and lots of other professional support, but it came years later. If I had got it sooner, I think I would’ve coped a lot more. CBT helped me so much in the end though. Many people with intractable epilepsy (epilepsy that is difficult to control) report that stress levels or other psychological problems can affect how often they have seizures. During CBT you are counseled and taught to think differently, and I found that changing my way of thinking could allow me to control my seizures more. CBT is a “talking treatment;” with a therapist I was able to explore how I felt about myself and the world. In the United States this is referred to as talk therapy or psychotherapy.

 

Epilepsy’s effect on parents and siblings
My seizures didn’t/don’t just affect my parents and me, they also affect my siblings. My brother is only 3 years younger, but he went through a lot. At the time of my diagnosis he was only 7. He was confused, upset, and he really did miss out on a lot as my parents attention was on me a lot of the time. My Mum did make a point in spending time with Joe and gave him the chance to ask questions, and my sister did too, but it was still hard on them.

Everyone needs time to himself or herself. This is especially important for parents and siblings of a person with epilepsy (or any medical condition really). If you don’t take time out for yourself, stress will rise. If you are a parent who has a child with epilepsy, please remember to set aside some time each week for yourself. It is essential. Go for a walk. Talk with friends. Sit and relax or watch a movie. My Mum says, looking back, she didn’t make enough time for her to just take a break from hospital visits and sleepless nights.

During the time that my seizures were at their worst, every time her phone rang at work, every time she saw a missed call or a voice message, her heart stopped because she just knew.

Her head never stopped spinning, her mind was already on me and whether or not I was okay.  It is difficult, but you must allow time for yourself.

 

Remembering to care for yourself
Many parents of children with epilepsy find themselves relying on family members to assist them with the care of their child if they want to go out. I have spoken to a couple of parents and they found their marriage was strained due to the constant work and stress of having a child who’s Epilepsy was severe. At the time when their Epilepsy was at its worst, they said they were close to divorce. The stress and tiredness put so much strain on them as a couple and they didn’t have any ‘me time’.  If there is a chance that you can find a babysitter you trust, a day care, a kids club, or if your child has friends who’s parents are willing to watch over your child, the favour being returned, then please reach out. It doesn’t for one moment mean you don’t care, or you can’t cope, you just need space.

I have spoken to a lot of people about the impact of Epilepsy on their family life, and some people explained that family members found it difficult to talk about their epilepsy, even if they were generally helpful. Some people have said that although their family gave them support, they did not tell their friends about their children’s epilepsy because their child wanted to keep it quiet. I recommend, from experience, that you tell anyone who spends time with you about your Epilepsy, because if you were to suddenly have a seizure, they need to know what to do and what to expect.

 

Keeping a positive attitude
Living with epilepsy can be really hard, but one of the top things I’d like to share with the readers here is attitude towards epilepsy. Your home environment is very important; if home life is stressful or negative it can have a huge impact. If, for example, a family members attitude towards epilepsy is a negative or judgmental one, the person with epilepsy will have negative feelings too. The same goes to friends; if a friend has Epilepsy or if your parent has epilepsy, don’t be negative about it because this contributes to the stigmas society has attached to epilepsy. Negative attitudes I have found during the last 11 years of my diagnosis have been lowered expectations-people being under the impression that I simply cannot do something because of my condition. This is not always the case.

My main aim with my campaign and awareness work is positivity, and it is something I want to spread and awareness is what I want to raise. I also believe that together we can make a huge difference, for the better.

“I think this is what we all want to hear: that we are not alone in hitting the bottom, and that it is possible to come out of that place courageous, beautiful, and strong.”

Leila’s Ideas: Camping with Epilepsy
 by Leila Zorzie |  posted in: Leila's Ideas |  0
Camp Lambec, on the shore of Lake Erie.
My home away from home: Camp Lambec, on the shore of Lake Erie.
Can you believe it’s July already?  For some of us, that means it’s the middle of summer! Camping is a popular activity during this time of the year.  Whether your family visits a campground every year or you go to sleep away camps, there are a few things you need to remember when camping with epilepsy.

Tips for camping with epilepsy:
Don’t forget your medication: I know this may seem like an obvious item to put on your packing sheet, but sometimes our medication makes us forgetful! Make sure your medication is the first thing you pack.  If it helps, use a pill box with the days of the week on it so you have enough to last you the whole week.  I always pack them in my purse because I take my purse with me everywhere, so there is no danger of me forgetting it!  It also helps me remember where I packed it when I need to take them later!
Make a packing list: A few days before you’re set to leave, write up a list of everything you need to pack.  In the days leading up to your departure, you can add things to the list that you forgot the first time.  When you begin to pack, you’ll know exactly what you need and can cross off items on the list as you go. I do this every time I travel and really cuts down on the number of things I forget.
Find out if there is a camp nurse: If you are going to a sleep away camp, chances are there will be a camp nurse on hand.  When you arrive, ask to meet the camp nurse so he/she knows who you are and you know who will help make this trip seizure-free.  Explain that you have epilepsy and, if you have triggers that may show up at camp (extreme heat, for example), make sure the nurse knows these triggers.  It will be easier for this person to care for you if he/she knows what type of care is needed.  If you’re not going to a camp with a nurse, make sure someone on the grounds knows your diagnosis, how to help if you do have a seizure, and who to call in case of emergency.
Camp Counselors: Some camps, like those put on by the Epilepsy Foundation, provide counselors for summer camps.  Depending who runs the camp, these counselors may have some ideas about responding to a seizure.  At Camp Frog, and others from the Epilepsy Foundation, counselors are trained in seizure first aid.  If your counselor isn’t trained, consider teaching them.  It won’t take long and then your counselor will be ready to help any time it is needed.  A camp nurse should also know seizure first aid, but the more people who can help, the better.
Know yourself: You are your own expert. You know what activities you can and cannot do, how your body feels, and if you need a break.  Don’t be afraid to speak up if you need to rest!  Going to camp can be so much fun, just remember to put your health first.
 

Let’s help one another
Have you been to camp yet this summer?  If you have, what was your secret to having a great week while camping with epilepsy?  If you haven’t been, do you have questions about camping with epilepsy?  Leave a note in the comments below so we can help each other have a wonderful summer that is full of fun!

Meet the Purple Wedges
 by Jessica Keenan Smith |  posted in: Purple Wedges |  0
IMG_1519Meet the Purple Wedges, Living Well With Epilepsy’s newest guide, raising epilepsy awareness around the country. The wedges will bring you on their purple epilepsy awareness adventures and you will see the sights from the perspective of these amazing traveling shoes. This is just a fun way to remind people that purple is the color for epilepsy and epilepsy needs a little awareness. Hope you follow along.

The Purple Wedges
This year I’ve been traveling to a few different cities for epilepsy related conferences. It just so happens, I have a pair of amazing purple wedges. They are beautiful suede and patent leather wedges that my mother insisted I buy years ago. So, a few months ago I brought the shoes with me on a trip to New York City.  This was an opportunity to take photos with the wedges (from their perspective of course) in fun, memorable locations.

Of course, I brought you all along with me through Twitter using the hashtag #wedgestakemanhattan. I was delighted to find you followed the adventures of the purple wedges. Just in case you missed the trip I have included a few photos below.

Purple Wedges in Manhattan

Purple Wedges in Chicago
More recently, the wedges hit Chicago. The weather was beautiful and the city was energized. Of course we used the hashtag, #wedgestakechicago. During the trip, I stumbled (no pun intended) upon a concert in Millenium park. It made me happy to see families of all shapes and sizes, colors and races together enjoying beautiful music.

Thank you Chicago for a momentary respite from the anger and tension felt around the world.

Traveling with Epilepsy: Finding Adventure in Slovenia
 by Maureen Knorr |  posted in: Traveling with Epilepsy |  2
DCIM100GOPRONo biking, no swimming, no driving, and don’t even think about having fun! That’s how a conversation with an epileptologist sounds. (They don’t actually say the “no fun” part, I just interpret it that way.) Reading alone? No, you could suffocate in your pillow! Soaking in a Jacuzzi? Do you want to drown? Repelling from a 50-meter waterfall? Ha, don’t even think about it! Honestly, I only got an eye-roll from my doctor when I mentioned repelling down waterfalls, so I took this as an off-record approval and booked a weekend getaway with my husband and friends to Bled, Slovenia. My goal: be brave and adventure!  

The Adventure
We booked a private canyoning trip with an experienced guide. My husband and I were nervous for two reasons. First, we aren’t athletes and canyoning is an all day event. You wake up early, eat protein bars, hike into the canyon (might I add that the hike is up a mountain in a wet-suit) and then, like a crazy person, you boulder your way down; jumping off big rocks into freezing cold water and repelling down steep cliffs and waterfalls. When I say it aloud, it actually doesn’t sound safe for even the strongest of athletes! We must be crazy!

 

The obvious reason we were nervous is because of my epilepsy. I can’t help but think, “what if I have a seizure right now?” when I am in a potentially dangerous situation. Especially because losing consciousness at the wrong time means I could really hurt myself, or worse. But as my readers know, I’ve learned that I can’t let that fear dictate my life.

 

As planned, we woke up early Saturday morning and hiked up the mountain in our rubbery wet-suits. I was exhausted by the time we reached the top! My calves ached and my heart was racing, but I was so excited for the adventure to come I still felt energized and ready to go. We jumped, slid, and scrambled down boulders like pros, or so it felt! The sun was shining, the air was brisk, and we were all smiles! Of course my mind drifted to the “what-ifs” but I didn’t let it stop me from taking the leap and enjoying the moment.  And then, I fell. In fact, I wiped out and ended up face down in the river. I jumped up fast but could already feel a boulder size bruise developing on my thigh. My husband’s eyes were wide with the “was that a seizure, or are you just clumsy?” look. I was 75% sure it was just a slip, but to be safe I took a long time to gather my thoughts and guts before I continued.

The Waterfall
The rest of my climb down was safe and fall-free, other than the intended falls!  The grand finale was repelling down a 50-meter waterfall! I opted for the “floating down” option, allowing our guide to support 100% of my weight, instead of taking the rope in my own hands. It was a safe choice for those that could have a seizure at any moment! Slowly gliding down that waterfall, entrusting my life to a thin rope, was incredibly exhilarating. I felt safe but also felt anything could happen. The day’s adventure wasn’t just about canyoning; it was about ignoring my fears, the “what-ifs,” and experiencing the day with an open heart.

Connect with your favorite epilepsy bloggers on tonight’s #LivingWellChat on Thursday, June 30 at 7PM ET on Twitter. We’ll be using the hashtag #LivingWellChat to filter out all the other social noise on the platform. The chat will last about 1 hour.

How does the chat work?
The format of #livingwellchat is very simple: We start with a general topic, and the conversation flows from there. Lots of Twitter chats have a formal structure, only allowing a few minutes per question, but #livingwellchat is a bit more open. We encourage spontaneous discussion with tons of Q&A.

Participating in LivingWellChat
1. Go to http://twubs.com/livingwellchat OR http://tweetchat.com/room/livingwellchat
2. Log in using your twitter account **IMPORTANT**
3. Set the chat speed as fast or slow as you prefer
4. The Twitter feed will pop up with all the #LivingWellChat tweets. You officially become part of the chat — all you have to do is write your thoughts in the box at the top of the feed. Don’t worry about adding #LivingWellChat at the end, both Tweetchat and Twubs add the hashtag in for you automatically.
5. Be sure to introduce yourself when you come on the chat

If you don’t have a twitter account
There are several options to follow along with the #LivingWellChat if you don’t have a Twitter account. Just remember you won’t be able to chime in with your own comments.

Option 1. Go to the Living Well With Epilepsy Facebook page and click on the Twitter tab at https://www.facebook.com/livingwellwithepilepsy/app/294627540601598/

Option 2. Go to http://livingwellwithepilepsy.com and watch the chat in the footer of the home page.

Can anyone join in the conversation?
Yep, please join in the chat. If you have been living with epilepsy for decades, if you are newly diagnosed, or if you are caring for a loved one who is living with epilepsy you will find something of interest on the next #LivingWellChat.

I hope to see you there!

Jillian’s Story
I had my first tonic-clonic seizure on July 27, 2012. I was 20 years old; perfectly healthy, getting ready to start my senior year of college and turn the big 21 in just a couple weeks. After MRI’s, EEG’s and meeting with a local neurologist, I was told I had abnormal brain waves and would now be considered epileptic. I was put on medication and that was that. I had almost forgotten about the bizarre occurrence when I had my second tonic-clonic seizure nearly two years later on May 24, 2014. For the past two years now I have experienced about one to three per month.

When I first began my journey through Epilepsy, I refused to consider myself epileptic. After all, there were people working through far worse cases of this complicated neurological disorder. I felt guilty telling people that I was epileptic. I felt like I was just looking for their pity and compassion. That I was just whining and serving as an annoyance if I talked about it since I didn’t seize every day and I was otherwise healthy. But no- One seizure is too many. We need to talk about it. There needs to be awareness.

Accepting epilepsy
The day I finally accepted Epilepsy as a part of my everyday life is when I finally felt the slightest (key word: slightest) bit of control and ownership over this maddening new obstacle in my life. I may not have a seizure every day, but I do wake up every morning with the same fear and the same hope. I do resort to cabs and friends to drive me where I need to go. I do swallow an increasingly large handful of anticonvulsant medications two times a day. I do endure the side effects these drugs bring with them. With acceptance comes peace. With peace comes strength to take control of your life no matter the obstacle.

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: From a Grieving Parent on Graduation Day

Shelby’s Story
I always end my blog posts by stating, “Epilepsy will not win”; although, on the day of what would be Clay’s high school graduation this June, Epilepsy will win (at least on that particular day). Clay will not be seated with his classmates in a cap and gown. He will not be grinning, that priceless grin, as he is surrounded by his lifelong friends. He will not be throwing his cap in pure joy, as they announce the graduating class of 2016, and we (his family) will not be crying tears of joy. We, instead, will be imagining what could have been.

 

There are a multitude of graduation ceremonies that will transpire this time of year (kindergarten, elementary, middle school, high school and college). All are events which bring mixed emotions, as they symbolize an end of an era in our childrens’ lives. They are one step closer to “letting go” and, as parents, our thoughts are flooded with memories of their younger years – “where did the time go”, we say? Though, we are excited for what their future will hold and imagine those coming memories. But, for the parents who have lost a child, the thoughts of this upcoming day (and the day itself) – there are no words to express the pain.

A grieving parent
As I sat to write my blog for this month and come up with an idea, there was nothing more that I wanted than to covey my thoughts on upcoming graduation events for the parents (and family members) which are going through grief, just as I and my family are experiencing. My heart goes out to the bereaved parents, for which graduations will never occur, as I am “that parent”, as well. I have found with grief that the anticipation of an event is sometimes worse than the actual day. I am hoping for this to be the case. I will remember that it is a date on a calendar – one day. I will get through this, just like the other milestones that didn’t occur. Our family will survive, and our son Clay, will live on through us and those whose lives which he touched. I will cry the day of graduation and hug our other children a little tighter than usual. I am certain that I will have a lump in my throat, a knot in my stomach and, I am certain, will clutch my “Clayton necklace” a little tighter that day. I will imagine what could have been and how unbelievably sad it is that I (and my family) have to imagine all of these events. “I” am only 1 of so many parents, sadly, who will be doing the same. Remember those graduates that aren’t able to experience this momentous event – and their families who wish that they could.

 

Although, as sad of a day as it will be, I will wait for photographs to appear on social media the day of graduation. I, honestly, cannot wait to see them. The children and families who were a part of Clay’s life and continue to be a part of ours. I will not be “looking” for my son in the crowd, I will be imagining him there celebrating. I have no doubt that he will be looking down with his incredible grin and his memory will live on with each member of his graduating class that was privileged to be a part of his life.

 

…and the day after graduation, “Epilepsy will not win” because his memory and spirit will live on. My family and I will have the joy of celebrating our other childrens’ graduations and, I have no doubt, that he will be right by our side in spirit at those events.

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: One husband’s story

Adrian’s Story
When many people think about a seizure, I feel they picture a person having violent muscle contractions and shaking. However, partial-onset seizures, which my wife Angela has, are more subtle. At first, I didn’t know what they were.

Angela began experiencing partial-onset seizures in 2001. I noticed that we would be talking, and the next minute she would stare blankly at me. She would also nod her head and say, “Yeah,” but not be aware she was speaking. I thought she was day dreaming, but when this kept happening, I knew something had changed. Angela went to the doctor and was diagnosed with partial-onset seizures.
Since Angela’s diagnosis, my family has banded together to love, support and care for her. I was frightened at first but knew that I needed to be there for her and our children. Over the years, I’ve learned a lot about what it means to be a caregiver for a person living with epilepsy.

A husband’s love
First, I educated myself on the symptoms of partial-onset seizures. I can usually now tell if Angela is about to experience a partial-onset seizure and if something appears to be “off.”

Second, I learned about the importance of communication. I try to speak with Angela often about her epilepsy to make sure she is doing okay. Communication is key in any marriage but even more important when your loved one has epilepsy.

Third, I learned to work together with Angela and her doctors to find a treatment option to help manage her partial-onset seizures. Each person with epilepsy is different and treatment options may vary. Angela tried various treatment options. She is currently taking Aptiom ® (eslicarbazepine acetate), an FDA approved prescription medicine used alone or with other medicines to treat partial-onset seizures. Both of us and her doctor have been happy with the reduction in the frequency of her partial-onset seizures. This is just Angela’s experience and these results may not be typical. It’s very important for people to discuss all the potential side effects of a medicine with their doctor before starting treatment.

Finally, I’ve learned to stay positive as a caregiver to help support Angela and my family. I’ll admit it’s not always easy. Epilepsy is a life-long condition and while Angela is the one living with it, I still can feel down, frustrated and stressed. However, when I do feel down, I think about Angela and what she is going through. I think about my children and how I need to be there for them. This helps me remain hopeful and positive.

Today, Angela and I are parents of five children, ranging from teenagers to young adults. I am so proud of Angela’s accomplishments as a mother, a wife and someone who is living with epilepsy. She is currently pursuing her goals to become a school psychologist and I will continue to be there for her and support her in whatever she wants to do in life. I know she would do the same for me.

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: Changing Stigma to Education

Rachel’s Story
First of all, I’d like to thank you all for reading this. It truly means way more than you know. Second, I’d like to introduce myself, for those that I have not met yet. My name is Rachel Ehrhardt. I’m from Houston, Texas and I am 30 years old. I began with febrile seizures as a baby until age four, and then they reared their ugly head again at age 16. I come from a family where three in my immediate family have epilepsy (father, sister, and myself) and a few in the extended family line as well.

One of my first memories I have of being treated differently others believing a stereotype/stigma was in high school. I had my first seizure in front of others at the age of 16 years old in the middle of debate practice after school. No one there had seen a seizure before. No one knew not to put things in my mouth. No one knew who or what to call. While I was in the ER the doctor continually asked and assumed that I was on drugs and would not listen to the fact that I had a history of seizures. That experience allowed me the opportunity to educate others what the disorder is–that no one regardless of a seizure can swallow their tongue; therefore this leaves no need to stick items in their mouths. This opportunity of my debate teacher not knowing (don’ t worry she knows now—I love you Mrs. Bell) what to do led me to having the full staff of my high school brought in for a seminar of what seizures are, the things to look for in their students, and what to do if a student does have one. After that seminar (with over 200 teachers) I found out that I had not only helped myself but there were 20 others students in the population of our school that had epilepsy as well and did not have a platform to be able to tell the staff of the school about their disorder.

Changing stigma
The second time I remember was a very big life changing experience. In 2012 I was driving my car back to Houston from a work trip in Dallas. I had felt off all day but did not listen to my body. About half way home I began seizing while driving going 80 MPH and went from the far left hand lane to the grass median on the far right side. The only thing I remember was waking up in a pool of blood. I will let you know first off that I sat in that pool of blood for over an hour. The state trooper refused to break open the window to get me out. They did not take me to a hospital and left me on the side of a road inside of an IHOP. This cop assumed I was on drugs and went ahead to report me to the Texas Department of Transportation, even though I was left on the side of the road in a pool of blood coming out of a seizure alone. He assumed I was on drugs and did not know my rights. I spent over 6 months with a suspended license. I had to go in front of a judge to prove to him that I really had not had a seizure in over 10 years and was medicated/ under medical care. I was given my license back thankfully and believe me I learned so much during that time about our rights and laws in Texas. I still fight this issue every single time I try and get my license. I have to prove to them that I truly know what I’m talking about and I am not on drugs. This has been one of my biggest passions the past few years is getting Troopers and Cops educated on what our disorder is and truly how to help them in times of crisis so this will never happen to someone else in Texas.

Thank you! I will not deny this road has not been an easy one, but I wouldn’t trade it for the world. I will also say that I don’t think I could ever get through this without the love and support of not only of my friends and family, but also mostly from my mom who is the only one out of our family that does not have a seizure disorder. She selflessly drives us to every appointment, Emergency Room visits, every test we have run, hospital stay, and the list goes on and on. THANK YOU!

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: A Day in the Life of an Epilepsy Blogger

Greetings from Washington DC
I am heading to the 2016 Partners Against Mortality in Epilepsy Conference (PAME) to cover the event for SUDEPAware. The event is meant to increase understanding of mortality in epilepsy—particularly Sudden Unexpected Death In Epilepsy (SUDEP)—by bringing together clinicians, researchers, public health officials and people who have epilepsy and their families/caregivers.

The PAME partnership is led by the American Epilepsy Society (AES), Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy (CURE) and the Epilepsy Foundation (EF). The 2016 PAME conference is the third biennial meeting hosted by the AES and planned by the PAME partnership.

This year the conference is being held in Alexandria, VA, just outside of Washington DC and I am thrilled to have the opportunity to attend this event, which blends families, researchers, and industry all in one event.

A day in the life
People often ask what it is like to blog about epilepsy. I thought it might be fun to share my schedule for the first day of the conference.

6:00am

It’s truth time. I hate mornings. I wish I was one of those people who woke up bounding with energy every morning. The reality is my husband gets up and brings me a hot cup of coffee every morning. I’m useless without that first cup. After a sip or two, I’m able to open my eyes and the first thing I do is check my site. I take a peek at the site traffic, then I respond to Twitter notifications, visit Facebook and finally respond to comments.

7:00am

Since I’ll be getting on the road I’ll need to make sure my phone, computer, cords, extra battery, camera are all packed and ready to go. Oh, and I can’t forget my meds, my tea, my snacks, and my sneakers since I’ll be in the DC area for a few days. I use all kinds of tricks to deal with memory issues and side effects. For example I’ll use one of the many whiteboards in the house to keep a list of what needs to come with me to DC.

IMG_36118:00am

Next I will pack up the car. Once I’m sure I’ve got everything, I’ll throw on some makeup and get ready for my first meeting before I even get on the road.

9:00am

Meet with a colleague at a local coffee shop to chat about innovative neurology projects in the pipeline.

IMG_400710:00am

Get on the road to DC and keep my fingers crossed for light traffic.

1:00pm

Text my family to let them know I arrived safely.

2:00pm

Meet with the staffs of Senator Cory Booker and Senator Robert Menendez  to discuss the importance of neurology research and the impact epilepsy has on public health.

4:00pm

Check in to PAME hotel and conference.

4:30pm

PAME Families Meeting will be an opportunity to meet with co-chairs, Jeff Buchhalter, MD, PhD, of Alberta Children’s Hospital and Gardiner Lapham, RN, MPH of Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy (CURE); Elizabeth Donner, MD, FRCPC of The Hospital for Sick Children; George Richerson, MD, PhD, of the University of Iowa; Tom Stanton, MPP of Danny Did Foundation; and Cyndi Wright of SUDEP Institute. This meeting will offer a primer on SUDEP.

7:00pm

The day will end with a welcome reception with remarks by the conference committee and Walter Koroshetz, MD, Director of the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).

9:00pm

After the reception I will head back to my room and thank my lucky stars for my snacks and my tea. I’ll climb into my pj’s to call my husband and daughter. I’ll pretend to watch television for a bit while I respond to any emails and notifications on Twitter and Facebook. Finally, I will double check to make sure everything is set for the next day of the Epilepsy Blog Relay. Around 11pm I’ll be out like a light.

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: Why I keep trying

Angela’s Story
I am 42 years old, a happy mother of five beautiful children, a wife and a student. I lead a very busy life and also happen to have epilepsy.

 

I was originally diagnosed with epilepsy in 2001. I started to daze off during conversations and would lose awareness for a minute or two. I didn’t know what was wrong with me and my husband and children were worried and scared. I went to my doctor who told me that I was having partial-onset seizures and diagnosed me with epilepsy.

 

Initially I was very surprised. I had three children prior to my diagnosis and did not have any seizures when I was younger. At the time, I didn’t understand what was happening to my body. I had many questions. Were my seizures sparked by hormones? Would my children have epilepsy? I am a person who likes answers and solutions. Once I was told I had epilepsy, I asked my doctors what I could do.

 

I worked with my doctors and tried different treatment options over the years to manage my partial-onset seizures. However, it was frustrating because I felt like my seizures weren’t improving and it felt like a step back.

 

A few years ago, I started to see a new doctor. We have a good relationship and communicate well with one another. I worked with her closely to find a different treatment option to treat my partial-onset seizures. Currently, I am taking Aptiom ® (eslicarbazepine acetate). APTIOM is an FDA approved prescription medicine used alone or with other medicines to treat partial-onset seizures. My doctor and I have been pleased with the reduction in the frequency of my partial-onset seizures. Of course, this is just my experience and these results may not be typical. It’s very important for people to discuss all the potential side effects of a medicine with their doctor before starting treatment. I feel like having a doctor that listens to me and that I can be open with has helped me tremendously during my treatment journey.

 

Some may think that having epilepsy limits what you can do. I do not feel like that is the case. In fact, knowing that I have epilepsy drives me to keep trying so I can be there for my family and pursue my career goals. I am currently in school studying to be a school psychologist because I want to help others. I am determined to finish school and know I will achieve this goal.

 

I hope others who have epilepsy keep trying as well and achieve what they want in life. Having epilepsy doesn’t mean you have to give up your dreams.

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: A Father’s Day note to the best dad ever
 by Guest Contributor |  posted in: Jun 16 LWWE Posts |  0
Rachel AblondiThis post is part of the Epilepsy Blog Relay™ that will run from June 1 through June 30. Follow along and add comments to posts that inspire you!

 

This post is written by Rachel Ablondi, who lives in Mount Airy, Maryland with her husband Dave. They are parents to Andrew who lives with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Amelia, Ava and Jenna. Living Well With Epilepsy™ is grateful to Lundbeck, a Sponsor of the June 2016 Epilepsy Blog Relay™.

 

Rachel’s Story
“Laughing, Loving, Kissing and Hugging….”

You don’t hear that so much from other dads, but you say these words quite a bit! You wouldn’t have expected such uplifting warm words to come from a tough guy dad whose son is diagnosed with cerebral palsy and a severe seizure disorder, named Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. Early on when I was pregnant with our first child our dreams of our future with our kids played out much differently. You’ve told me your dreams involved father and son fishing trips, hiking trips to the mountains, baseball practice and games and all that kind of manly stuff. You grew up this way, and frankly neither of us knew life any other way, until the day Andrew was born.

 

Instead of dwelling on the “normal” child we lost, you focused on the perfect child that was now a part of our life. Andrew required extra care, but that didn’t stop you from focusing on bringing out Andrew’s smile and his laugh. Remember how you would bounce Andrew on our couch until he giggled out of control, and when you massaged his belly after his bath so he would gleefully yell, “EEEEEE!!” Hearing Andrew’s laugh and seeing him smile made all of his difficulties non-existent just for those moments in time. We all needed that. When Andrew was three we took hiking trips even though Andrew could not walk himself. I’ll never forget how you carried Andrew up the Jenny Lake Trail in the Grand Teton Mountains so that Andrew could feel the mountain air and see the tallest trees all for himself. Even though you were exhausted, what was important to you was that we were all together doing our favorite things no matter what obstacle was in our way. Not every dad takes his young son for walks, around and around, up and down hills in the neighborhood for hours just because his son liked the sensation to just keep on moving. Every summer there is no doubt that Andrew will be playing on the beach with his cousins. You wouldn’t have it any other way. You push that awkward wheelchair in the blazing sun through the deep sand just to get him there. Andrew may not play baseball, but you do make time for him to roll on his ball, one of his favorite things. Did you know you had such strength, did you know you had that kind of love inside for somebody else? You do, and you are the best dad.

 

Your dedication isn’t only to Andrew and our girls, but to me as well. You have given me the greatest support over these past 16 years. You are always available to listen and stand behind any decisions I make. For those scariest of times such as hospital stays when we are the most consumed with worry you hold down the fort at home so that I can be where I want to be, by Drew’s side. Our date nights are simple. They consist of hamburgers and a movie on a late Friday night, every single Friday night, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. We have made this time for each other because we know having this time helps us to be better parents. You make sure I have time away with my friends whether it is for a lunch date or a weekend getaway. I know taking care of four children by yourself is overwhelming, but you don’t complain.

 

Andrew’s daily seizures are our biggest worry. That worry is with us no matter where we are. I know it’s hard for you to grasp that religiously giving medicines several times a day have little to no impact on the daily seizures that are interfering with our son’s brain. It is so difficult to not be able to help Andrew, when he needs help the most. I know you wish there was more we could do to help him. I wish that too. You fix everything, but somehow we can’t stop Drew’s seizures. You don’t let the unpredictability of these diseases get in the way of the love you have for your family, especially for your son. That is to be commended.

Happy Father’s Day
Happy Father’s Day to you Dave, and also to all the great dads like you who put their child with special needs first. You are great dads, the best of them all. Here’s to even more laughing, loving, kissing and hugging!

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: Maureen finds peace despite her fears

Maureen’s Story
Want to hear a bizarre secret? I’m terrified of walking down stairs! And I have developed some seriously bizarre habits because of this fear. To name a few, I won’t walk downstairs unless my husband is in front of me. I also grip onto the hand railing as if my legs could give out at any moment. This entails both hands on the railing with one elbow pressed in for speed control. And in the mornings I sit and scoot down the stairs in a toddler-like fashion. Casually trotting downstairs is out of the question! The stair distress comes from numerous seizure stories ending with, “And the next thing I remember is waking up, laying at the bottom of the staircase.”

I’ve had countless tumbles down staircases; drifting back into consciousness with the question of, “how did I get here?” floating around my head as I wiggle my toes and fingers to assess the damage. I’m not the only person living with epilepsy that has felt like a chalk drawing etched into the pavement at a crime scene. Loosing consciousness at the most inconvenient time is part of living with epilepsy. So, it’s no wonder I look at stairs like an obstacle course!

Finding peace
2015-08-21 11.30.51 (1)Skógafoss, a waterfall in the South of Iceland, was a doorway that forced me to put aside this anxiety. It’s a powerful fall from below, but the real majesty is climbing around 200+ stairs for the spectacular view and serenity. With my first step up I was already thinking about the possible tumble down, but I wasn’t going to let that stop me. Instead of silently letting these thoughts circulate round and round (which is what I usually do!), I confessed to my husband that I was already dreading coming back down. I told him countless stories of somersaulting down flights of stairs, waking up in a twisted formation, and clueless of what happened. I wanted him to understand why in the middle of a beautiful hike in Iceland, my mind was already fixated on the journey back down. The more I acknowledged my fear, the more at peace I felt.

The top of the waterfall was just as beautiful and tranquil as described, perfectly reflecting this newfound sense of calmness I had found. We sat in silence admiring surroundings. Watching the water tumble down reminded me of how powerful and unpredictable the world can be, and that included my sense of self in this world.  I gave into the idea that unpredictability is the way of everyone’s and everything’s life. And that shouldn’t cause fear or change our behavior.

When we started our decent, I scolded myself for dwelling on the unpredictably of epilepsy.  There was nothing positive about focusing on the “would ifs”, and no matter how slowly I took each step or how hard I gripped the handrail, it wouldn’t stop a seizure from knocking me down. There was no point for me to adopt these crazy preventative habits when they wouldn’t prevent a seizure anyways!  With that in mind, I let the hand railing go and trotted down, two steps at a time! As silly as it sounds, I felt empowered and like a different person!

Next time I find myself over-analyzing each step down, I’ll remind myself how great if feels to push those thoughts aside and know that even though, I can’t control when a seizure will hit, I can control how I live each moment.

Epilepsy Blog Relay™: It’s not just other people

I was told college would be too difficult for me; now I have a degree and am happily working in education.

Leila’s Story
We’re talking all about stigma this month.  So far, we’ve read some great stories. There have been posts on saying no to stigma, on using career and fitness goals to fight stigma, and the importance of speaking out about stigma and epilepsy.  We need to continue to have discussions about epilepsy, and we must remember our personal stories have a positive impact on others.

 

It’s sad to say, but the stigma associated with epilepsy doesn’t just come from other people. Sometimes stigma can take root within the hearts and minds of people living with epilepsy. It is hard enough to deal with seizures, medications, side effects, and assumptions made by those who don’t understand the disease. It’s possible to begin to believe the stigma yourself.

 

Maybe side effects from medications make you forgetful, and as a result you have difficulty in school.  Perhaps a side effect of your episodes is that you are tired often, and therefore you have less energy to be active.  It could be that you must limit your activities based off of safety concerns from a doctor.  Whatever you feel your limit is, you may believe you can’t go past it and are a victim of your epilepsy.

 

I’m here to ask you to try to stop thinking that way.  Remember, you are not a victim of your diagnosis. You have the ability to do great things and surpass limits set by other people.  If you keep repeating the negative stigma you hear, you will start to believe it.  Instead, say positive things!

Try a few of the following ideas:

Look at yourself in the mirror every day and give a compliment to yourself.
Leave encouraging notes for yourself throughout your environment (I put them in my planner).
Set goals for yourself and work hard to achieve them.
Remember to give yourself a break!  No one is able to complete all their goals in one day; you shouldn’t expect yourself to do so either.
 

Being limited by medications or symptoms says nothing about your abilities; meeting your goals and overcoming your own obstacles speaks volumes!  You don’t need to agree with the people who tell you college will be too difficult, that you can’t be friends with others based on your diagnosis, or that your personal hobbies aren’t right for you.

 

Yes, you should always listen to your doctor and not do unsafe activities.  You need to listen to your body and know your limits; stress and exhaustion are not friends of seizures.  Try not  to give in to other people’s beliefs of you.  You are in control. You are in charge of how you see yourself. You can encourage yourself, love yourself, and believe in yourself. You are more than your diagnosis.
